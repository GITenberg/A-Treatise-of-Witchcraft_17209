these last dayes, and perillous times, among the rest of those dreadfull
euills, which are fore-told should abound<a class = "tag" name = "tagSa"
href = "#noteSa">a</a> in them, a close &amp; disguised contempt of
religion may be iustly accounted as chiefe, which causeth and bringeth
vpon men all disastrous effects, when although it be shadowed with a
beautifull Maske of holines, faire tongued: yet false-harted,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagSb" href = "#noteSb">b</a> <i>professing they know God,
but in works deny him</i>. And among these there be two especiall sorts;
the one, who entertaining a stubborne, and curious rash boldnes, striue
by the iudgemẽt of reason, to search ouer-deeply into the knowledge of
those things which are farre aboue the reach of any humane capacitie.
And so making shipwracke in this deep and vnfoundable Sea, ouerwhelme
themselues in the gulfe thereof. The other kind is more sottish, dull,
and of a slow wit,
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
and therefore ouer-credulous, beleeuing euerie thing, especially when
they be carried by the violent tempest of their desires, and other
vngouerned affections; and among these the diuell vsually spreadeth his
netts, as assured of a prey, wayting closely if hee can espie any, who
either grow discontented and desperate, through want and pouerty, or be
exasperated with a wrathfull and vnruly passion of reuenge, or
transported by vnsatiable loue to obtaine some thing they desire; and
these hee taking aduantage, assaulteth with golden and glorious
promises, to performe vnto them the wishes of their owne hearts; the
drift whereof is (hee being as at the first incased in a subtile
Serpents skinne) onely to enthrall and invassall them slaues to
himselfe. The first of these mentioned, are slie and masked Atheists,
who ouer-shadow their secret impiety, loose and dissolute behauiour with
some outward conformitie and shew of religion, snatching (as they
thinke) a sufficient warrantize thereof from those disorders they
obserue among men, and therfore passe vncensured, hauing a ciuill, but
dissembled carriage. The second be Sorcerers, Wisards, Witches, and the
rest of that ranke and kindred: no small multitude swarming now in the
world, yet supposed of many, rather worthy pitty then punishment, as
deluded by fantasies, and mis-led, not effecting those harmes wherewith
they bee charged, or themselues acknowledge. But considering they be
ioyned and linked together with Satan in a league (the common and
professed
<span class = "folionum">A3</span>
enemy of mankinde) and by his helpe performe many subtile mischieuous
actions, and hurtfull designes, it is strange that from so great a
smoake arising, they neither descrie nor feare some fire. And therefore,
in respect of these, I haue at your appointment and request (for whom I
am most willing to bestow my best labours and euer shall be) penned this
small Treatise, occasioned by the detection of a late witch among you,
whose irreligious care, and vnwearied industry, is not to be defrauded
of deserued commendation, and by mature deliberation, and descreete
search, found out her irreligious and impious demeanour, and also
discouered sundry her vnnaturall and inhumane mischiefes done to others,
whereof being conuicted, she was accordingly sentenced, and did vndergoe
the penalty iustly appointed, and due by Law vnto malefactors of that
kinde. After all which, you kindled with a holy zeale of the
aduauncement of Gods glorie, and giuing satisfaction to euery one
howsoeuer affected, intermitted no meanes, vsing therein the labour of
your carefull Ministers (willingly offering themselues in this holy
seruice) whereby she might be broght (as one conuerted in the last
houre) to the sight &amp; acknowledgement of her heinous sins in
generall, &amp; particularly of that of witchcraft, confessing the same,
&amp; by true repentance, and embracing of the tender mercies of God in
Christ Iesus saue her soule (who refuseth no true and vnfained conuert
at any time.) And hee gratiously blessing these religious endeuors of
yours, vouchsafed
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
to second the same with a happy and wished for euent, which (as I hope)
shall appeare manifestly in the following Treatise vnto all those who
are not fondly, &amp; without cause, too much wedded to their owne
conceits: And thus, desiring GOD most humbly to confirme and strengthen
you in his truth, which euer you haue loued, and is your due praise, and
shall be at the last an honour vnto you: I rest</p>

Reader, I haue vpon occasion penned this short discourse, and that of
such a subject wherewith not being well acquainted, am enforced to craue
some direction from those, whose names you shall finde remembred in the
same: (that I be not vnthankefull vnto those from whom I receiue
instruction) and haue in former time, and latter dayes, taken paines in
searching out, both the speculatiue, and practique parts of this
damnable Art of Witchcraft, a dangerous and seducing inuention of
Sathan, who from the Arcenals, and Magisins store-houses of his ancient
and mischieuous furniture, hath not spared to affoord all helpe, and the
best Engines for the subuerting of soules, pliable to his allurements:
and to this end, beside a plaine narration of fact in this case
committed and confessed, (least the Treatise should be too bare and
naked) I haue added thereunto a few Propositions, agreeing to such a
subiect matter, manifesting some speciall poynts not altogether
impertinent in my opinion, nor vnworthy of due consideration: I know
mine owne wants, and do as willingly acknowledge them: One more
experienced, and of greater leasure, and better health, had beene fitter
for the opening and discouering of so deepe a mystery, and hidden secret
of Iniquity, as this is; and haply hereafter may be willing to take that
taske in hand: yet herein thou shalt finde something not vsuall: A
manifest contract made with the Diuell, and by the solemne tearmes of a
league, which is the ground of all the pernitious actions proceeding
from those sorts of people, who are, haue beene, and shall be
practioners in that cursed and hellish Art. And yet no more then she,
that Witch of whom
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
in this relation we do speake, hath of her owne accord, and voluntarily
acknowledged after conference had <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads 'wit hme'">with me</ins>, and sundry learned and reuerend
Diuines, who both prayed for her conuersion, carefully instructed her in
the way to saluation, and hopefully rescued her from the Diuell, (to
whom she was deuoted, and by him seduced) and regained her to God, from
whom she was departed by Apostacie. And in this so Christian and holy
action were the continuall paines of</p>

wise would condiscend vnto should be deferred, though offered repriuall
vpon hope that more might haue beene acknowledged) being very
distemperate, neuerthelesse some accompanied her to the place, and were
both eye and eare-witnesses of her behauiour there, seeing and hearing
how she did then particularly confesse her confederacy with the Diuell,
cursing, banning, and enuy towards her neighbours, and hurts done to
then, expressing euery one by name, so many as be in the following
discourse, nominated, and how she craued mercy of God, and pardon for
her offences, with other more specialties afterward expressed. And thus
I end, taking my leaue, and commending thee to the gracious guidance and
preseruation of our good God in our blessed Sauiour Christ Iesus.</p>

is some diuersitie of iudgement among the learned, who should be the
first Author and Inuenter of Magicall and curious Arts. The most
generall occurrence of opinion is, that they fetch their pedigree from
the <a class = "tag" name = "tagPa" href =
"#notePa">a</a><i>Persians</i>, who searching more deeply into the
secrets of Nature then others, and not contented to bound themselues
within the limits thereof, fell foule of the Diuell, and were insnared
in his nets.</p>
<p>
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
And among these, the publisher vnto the world was <i>Zoroaster</i>, who
so soone as he by birth<a class = "tag" name = "tagPb" href =
"#notePb">b</a> entred the world, contrary to the vsuall condition of
other men, laughed (whereas the beginning of our life is a sob, the end
a sigh) and this was ominous to himselfe, no warrantise for the enioying
of the pleasures of this life, ouercome in battell by <i>Ninus</i><a
class = "tag" name = "tagPc" href = "#notePc">c</a> King of the
<i>Assirians</i>, and ending his dayes by the stroake of a thunder-bolt,
and could not, though a famous Sorcerer, either fore-see, or preuent his
owne destinie. And because he writ many bookes of this damnable Art, and
left them to posterity, may well be accounted a chiefe maister of the
same. But the Diuell<a class = "tag" name = "tagPd" href =
"#notePd">d</a> must haue the precedencie, whose schollers both he and
the rest were, who followed treading in his steps. For he taught them
South-saying, Auguration, Necromancie, and the rest, meere delusions,
aiming therein at no other marke, then to with draw men from the true
worshipping of God. And all these pernitious practises are fast tied
together by the tailes, though their faces looke sundry wayes; and
therefore the Professors thereof are stiled by sundry names, as
Magitians, Necromancers, Inchanters, Wisards, Hagges, Fortune-tellers,
Diuiners, Witches, Cunning Men, and Women, &amp;c. Whose Art is such a
hidden mystery of<a class = "tag" name = "tagPe" href = "#notePe">e</a>
wickednesse, and so vnsearchable a depth of Sathan, that neither the
secrets of the one can be discouered, nor the bottome of the other
further sounded,
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<span class = "folionum">B2</span>
then either the practisers thereof themselues by their owne voluntary
confessions made, or procured by order of Iustice (according to the
manner of that Countrey where they be questioned) haue acknowledged, or
is manifested by the sundry mischiefes done of them vnto others, proued
by impartiall testimonies vpon oath, and by vehement presumptions
confirmed, or else communicated vnto vs in the learned Treatises, and
discourses of ancient and late Writers gathered from the same grounds.
And<a class = "tag" name = "tagPf" href = "#notePf">f</a> although this
Hellish Art be not now so frequent as heretofore, since the Pagans haue
beene conuerted vnto Christianity, and the thick fogges of Popery
ouer-mantling the bright shining beames of the Gospel of <i>Iesus
Christ</i> (who came to dissolue the workes of the Diuell <i>.1. Ioh. 3.

dispersed; yet considering these bee the last times, dayes euill &amp;

therefore Magistrates who inflict any punishment vpon them, be
vnmercifull and cruell Butchers. Yet by the way, and their good leaue,
who take vpon them this Apology, all who are conuented vpon these
vnlawfull action, are not strucken in yeares; but some euen in the
flower of their youth be nuzled vp in the same, and convicted to be
practisers thereof; neither be they ouerflowed with a blacke
melancholique humor, dazeling the phantasie, but
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<span class = "folionum">B3</span>
haue their vnderstandings cleere, and wits as quicke as other: Neither
yet be they all women, though for the most part that sexe be inclinable
thereunto: (as shall afterward be shewed, and the causes thereof) but
men also on whose behalfe no exception can be laid, why any should
demurre either of their offence or punishment for the same. Wherefore
for this point, and confirmation of the affirmatiue, wee haue sundry
pregnant and euident proofes.</p>

<p>First testimonies Diuine and Humane: Diuine of <i>God</i> himselfe in
his word,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1b" href = "#note1b">b</a> left for
our instruction in all dogmaticall truth, reproofe and confutation of
falshood in opinions, correction for the reforming of misdemeaners in
conuersation, doctrine for the guidance of euery estate Politicall,
Ecclesiasticall, Oeconomicall. <i>2. Timoth. 3. 16.</i> Therefore
expressely, <i>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch, to liue, Exod. 22.
18.</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag1c" href = "#note1c">c</a> but to bee
executed in the same day wherein she is conuicted, and this was a
custome obserued by the ancient Fathers. And <i>Deuteronomy 18.
10.11.</i> there is a blacke Bill set downe<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1d" href = "#note1d">d</a>, and registred of sundry kinds of these
slaues of Sathan, all condemned, and God addeth in the same place the
reasons of this his seuere and sharpe iudgement against them. First,
because they are an abhomination vnto him. Secondly, he determineth
vtterly to destroy all such, and giueth his people the Israelites an
example thereof in the Canaanites, whom their Land spewed out. Thirdly,
for that he requireth all who belong vnto him, to be pure, vndefiled and
holy,
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
not stained with impieties, for they are bound vnto him by couenant in
obedience. Fourthly such were the Heathen, strangers from God, blinded
in their dark vnderstanding, without sauing knowledge, with whom the
Israelites, a chosen and peculiar nation, enioying his lawes and
statutes, must haue no familiarity. Further, the woman of <i>Endor</i>
acknowledgeth herselfe to be one of the rank. <i>1. Sam. 28. 9</i>. And
<i>Iesabel</i>, mother of <i>Iehoram</i>, is in plaine tearmes stiled a
Witch. <i>2. King. 9. 22.</i> who is <a class = "tag" name = "tag1e"
href = "#note1e">e</a>supposed to haue brought this Art, and the
Professors thereof into <i>Samaria</i>, which there continued for the
space of sixe hundred yeares. Insomuch that it was rife in common
speech, when any would reproach another, to doe the same in this forme;
<i>Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a Diuell</i> (a familiar spirit) which
the malicious Iewes, not abiding his heauenly and gracious doctrine,
obiected to Christ Iesus our blessed Sauiour, <i>Ioh. 8. 48</i>. The
holy Apostle reprouing the <i>Galathians</i> for their sudden Apostasie
and back-sliding from the Gospell so powerfully preached vnto them and
with so great euidence of the spirit, as though Christ had bin crucified
before their eyes, doth it in no other termes than these, <i>Who hath
bewitched you?</i> <i>Gal. 3. 1</i>. And afterward, <i>Cap. 5. 20.</i>
marshalleth Witch-craft among the workes of the flesh: In both which
places the names are taken from the seducements and illusions of
Inchanters, who astonish the mindes, and deceiue the senses of men, and
all that by vertue of a contract passed betwene them and the Diuell.
Other like proofes
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
may be added to these alledged, <i>Leuit. 20. 6.</i> <i>Micah 5. 12.</i>
<i>Nahum 3. 4</i>. Now then when God affirmeth there be such, whose
words are truth, shall man dare once to open his mouth, and contradict
the most righteous?</p>

<p>Concerning humane witnesses, they be almost infinite; and therefore
it shall be sufficient to produce some few, choyce, and selected: <a
class = "tag" name = "tag1f" href = "#note1f">f</a>The second Councell
of <i>Constantinople</i> held and gathered together in the Imperiall
palace, of two hundred seuen and twenty learned and reuerent Bishops,
nameth sundry sorts of such Sorcerers, and censureth their actions to be
the damned practises of the Pagans, and decreeth all the Agents therein
excommunicated from the Church and society of Christian people, adding
the motiue reason of this their determined sentence, from the Apostle,
<i>2. Cor. 6. 14</i>. For righteousnesse hath no fellowship with
vnrighteousnesse, neither is there communion of light with darknesse,
nor concord with Christ and Belial, nor the beleeuer can haue part with
an Infidell. And <a class = "tag" name = "tag1g" href =
"#note1g">g</a><i>Chrysostome</i> sharply reproueth all such, and those
who aduise with them vpon any occasion, confuting the reasons which they
take to be sufficient warantise of their doings. As among the rest they
will pretend, Shee was a Christian woman who doth thus charme or
inchant; and taketh no other but the name of God in her mouth, vseth the
words of sacred Scripture. To this that holy Father
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
replieth, Therefore she is the more to be hated, because shee hath
abused and taken in vaine that great and glorious name, and professing
herselfe a Christian, yet practiseth the <a class = "tag" name = "tag1h"
href = "#note1h">h</a>damnable Arts of miscreant and vnbeleeuing
Heathen. For the Diuels could speake the name of God, and neuerthelesse
were still Diuels; and when they said vnto Christ, they knew who he was,
the holy one of God, &amp;c. <i>Mar. 1. 24.25.</i> their mouthes were
stopped, he would no such witnesse, that wee should learne, not to
beleeue them when they say the truth: for this is but a bait, that wee
might afterward follow their lies. There is much mention made of these,
both in the Ciuill and <a class = "tag" name = "tag1i" href =
"#note1i">i</a>Canon Lawes, and diuersitie of punishment alotted out for
them; so that none can doubt but that there hath beene, and are such. I
might remember vnto you the authority of <i>Clemens Romanus</i> in his
Recognitions, and those Constitutions which are fathered vpon the
Apostles; but their credit is not so great, that they may without
exception be impannelled vpon this Iury, for they haue long since been
chalenged of <a class = "tag" name = "tag1k" href =
"#note1k">k</a>insufficiencie.</p>

<p>Among the Gentiles, when these so qualitied persons did swarme, and
were accounted of high esteeme, there be reckoned vp whole troopes of
this blacke guard of the Diuell; As <a class = "tag" name = "tag1l" href
= "#note1l">l</a><i>Circe</i> whom <i>Homer</i> reporteth to haue turned
<i>Vlysses</i> Companions into Wolues, Lyons, Swine, &amp;c. by her
Inchantments, insauaging and making them beast-like and furious.
<i>Medea</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag1m" href = "#note1m">m</a>
famous in this kinde, for she murthered by Witch-craft <i>Glauca</i>
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<span class = "folionum">C</span>
in the day of her marriage, who enioyed <i>Iason</I> her loue. And<a
class = "tag" name = "tag1n" href = "#note1n">n</a> the Mortars of these
two, wherein they stamped their Magicall drugges, were for a long time
kept in a certaine mountaine, and shewed as strange monuments to those
who desired a sight of them. For <a class = "tag" name = "tag1o" href =
"#note1o">o</a>the Diuel furnisheth such with powders, oyntments,
hearbes, and like receipts, whereby they procure sicknesse, death,
health, or worke other supernaturall effects. Of the same profession
were <a class = "tag" name = "tag1p" href =

"#note1r">r</a><i>Canidia</i>, and infinite others beside, whose
damnable memory deserueth to be buried in euerlasting obliuion.</p>

<p>But because the reports of these may seeme to carry small credit, for
that they come from Poets, who are stained with the note of licentious
<a class = "tag" name = "tag1s" href = "#note1s">s</a>faining, and so
put off as vaine fictions; yet seeing they deliuer nothing herein but
that which was well knowne and vsuall in those times wherein they liued,
they are not slightly, and vpon an imagined conceit, to be reiected: for
they affirme no more then is manifest in the records of most approued
Histories, whose essence is and must be <a class = "tag" name = "tag1t"
href = "#note1t">t</a>truth, <a class = "tag" name = "tag1u" href =

particulars, there bee infinite numbers ouerflowing euen in these our<a
class = "tag" name = "tag1cc" href = "#note1cc">cc</a> dayes,
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
since the sinceritie of Christian Profession hath decreased, and beene
in a sort ecclipsed in the hearts of men: for the period of the
continuance thereof (after it be once imbraced) in his first integrity,
either for zeale of affection, or strictnesse of discipline, hath beene
by some learned Diuines<a class = "tag" name = "tag1dd" href =
"#note1dd">dd</a> obserued, to bee confined within the compass of twenty
yeares; and then afterward by degrees, the one waxed cold, and the other
dissolute: which being so, it is not to be maruelled though the Diuell
now begin to shew himselfe in these his instruments, as heretofore,
though he cannot in the same measure, in respect of those sparkes of
light which yet shine amongst vs. But of this so much now, because I
shall haue afterward occasion further to enlarge this poynt.</p>

<p>Againe, the policie of all States<a class = "tag" name = "tag1ee"
href = "#note1ee">ee</a> haue prouided for the rooting out of these
poysonfull Weedes, and cutting of these rotten and infected members; and
therefore infallibly prouing their existence and being: for all<a class
= "tag" name = "tag1ff" href = "#note1ff">ff</a> penall lawes looke to
matters of fact and are made to punish for the present, and preuent in
future, some wicked actions already committed. And therefore
<i>Solon</i> the Athenian making statutes for the setling of that
Common-wealth, when a defect was found, that he omitted to prouide a
cautelous restraint, and appoint<a class = "tag" name = "tag1gg" href =
"#note1gg">gg</a> answerable punishmẽt for such who had killed their
parents, answered, He neuer suspected there were or would be any such.
Wherefore to confirme the position set downe, God doth
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<span class = "folionum">C2</span>
not threaten to cast away his people for murther, incest, tyranny,
&amp;c. But Sorcery, <i>Leuit. 20. 6</i>. And <i>Samuel</i> willing to
shew <i>Saul</i> the grieuousnesse of his disobedience, compareth it to
witch-craft, <i>1. Sam. 15. 23</i>. The Holy Ghost also manifesting how
highly God was displeased with <i>Manasses</i>, maketh this the reason,
because hee gaue himselfe to Witch-craft, and to Charming, and to
Sorcery, and vsed them who had familiar spirits, and did much euill in
the sight of the Lord to anger him, <i>2. Chro. 33. 6</i>. And for this
offence were the ten tribes of Israell led into captiuitie, <i>2. King.
17. 17.</i> <a class = "tag" name = "tag1hh" href = "#note1hh">hh</a>The
twelue Tables of the Romans (the ancientest law they haue) by a solemne
Embassage (sent for that purpose) obtained from <i>Athens</i>, &amp;
accounted as a Library of knowledge, do both make mention of such
malefactors, &amp; decree a penaltie to be inflicted vpon them. <a class
= "tag" name = "tag1ii" href = "#note1ii">ii</a><i>Constantius</i> and
<i>Constantinus</i> thinke them worthy of some vnusuall death, as
enemies of mankinde, strangers from nature: <a class = "tag" name =
"tag1kk" href = "#note1kk">kk</a>and <i>Iulius Paulus</i> distinguishing
the punishment according to the different qualitie of the offenders,
pronounceth out of the then receiued opinions, that the better sort
found guilty, were to dye (not determining the manner) those of meaner
condition either to bee crucified, or deuoured of wilde beasts.</p>

<p>Our ancient Saxon Kings before the <a class = "tag" name = "tag1ll"
href = "#note1ll">ll</a>Conquest, haue in their municipall Lawes
apparantly demonstrated what they conceiued of these so dangerous and
diuellish persons. <i>Alucidus</i> keepeth the expresse words of God;
<i>Fœminas sagas</i>
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<i>ne sinite viuere</i>. Suffer not women Witches to liue.
<i>Gunthrunus</i> and <i>Canutus</i> will haue them, being once
apprehended (that the rest of the people might bee pure and vndefiled)
sent into banishment, or if they abide in the kingdome (continuing their
lewd practises) executed according to desert. So <i>Athelstane</i>, if
they be conuicted to haue killed any, &amp;c. And how the present estate
standeth affected toward them, the sundry strict statutes in this case
prouided, may giue any, not wedded to his owne stubbornenesse,
sufficient and full satisfaction. Wherefore not to erect a Tabernacle,
and dwell longer in perswading an vndeniable truth, that there bee
Sorcerers and Witches, I leaue these Hellish Infidels, and proceede.</p>

dumbe, blinde, &amp;c. whom he might deliuer from these torments, and so
make apparant his glory, and shew by these his miracles wrought, that
hee was the promised Messias, <i>Esay 35. 5.6</i>. And therfore Christ
referreth those Disciples whom <i>Iohn</i> sent vnto him (doubting in
respect of that base forme which he tooke, and demanding whether it was
he that should come, or another to be looked for) vnto his Doctrine and
Workes; and by them to bee instructed, whereof they were then both
hearers and beholders, <i>Math. 11. 3.4.5</i>. So now comming in the dew
of his grace, and hauing restored the light of the Gospell, and bestowed
that vpon mankinde, as an especiall and vnvaluable blessing, in his
iustice giueth ouer the despisers thereof vnto the power of Sathan,
whereby both others who contemne the same, might by their dreadfull
example bee terrified, and the faithfull stirred vp to a respectiue
thankfulnesse, for so great a mercy vouchsafed vnto them, and
acknowledge their happinesse in being made partakers thereof, and by
especiall fauour deliuered out of the tyranny of the Diuell: For this is
one of the fearefull iudgements of God, and hidden from vs (as all are a
great depth, <i>Psal. 36. 6.</i>) that those who receiued not the truth
that they might be saued, should haue strong delusions sent vnto them,
and bee giuen ouer to belieue Sathan and his lying signes, and false
wonders, <i>2. Thess.</i> 2. 10.
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
And thus consenting vnto sinne, and his suggestions, they are depriued
of the <a class = "tag" name = "tag2b" href = "#note2b">b</a>helpe and
assistance of God, and so disabled to resist all violent rushing
temptations: for one offence, not being truely repented of, bringeth
another, and at last throweth head-long downe into hell: and by this
meanes man despising God his creator &amp; redeemer, and obeying the
Diuell a professed enemy, and irreconciliable aduersary, not easie to be
confronted, becommeth his seruant: for of whomsoeuer any is ouercome,
euen of the same is hee brought into bondage, <i>2. Pet. 2. 19</i>. And
the Apostle giueth as the reason why the heathen were so sottish
Idolaters, and defiled themselues with many detestable and loathsome
sinnes, <a class = "tag" name = "tag2c" href = "#note2c">c</a>because
when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were
thankfull, therefore God gaue them ouer to a reprobate sence, and vile
affections to doe those things which were not conuenient, full of all
vnrighteousnesse, <i>Rom 1. 24.25. &. 29</i> So these being enthralled,
and deuoting themselues to the Diuell by a mutuall league (either
expresse or secret) he brandeth with his mark for his <a class = "tag"
name = "tag2d" href = "#note2d">d</a>owne, as in ancient time was an vse
with Bondslaues and <a class = "tag" name = "tag2e" href =

"ezôgrêmenoi">ἐζωγρημένοι</span>, taken aliue in his snare, <i>2. Tim.
2. 26.</i> and that in some part of the body, least either suspected or
perceiued by vs (for hee is a cunning concealer) as vnder the eye-lids,
or in the palat of the mouth,
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
or other secret places: Wherefore some Iudges cause them, once being
called into question, and accused, to be shauen all the body<a class =
"tag" name = "tag2f" href = "#note2f">f</a> ouer. And for the manner of
impression, or branding, it is after this sort. The Diuell when hee hath
once made the contract betweene himselfe and the Witch, and agreed vpon
the conditions, what they shall doe, the one for the other, giueth her
some scratch<a class = "tag" name = "tag2g" href = "#note2g">g</a>,
which remaineth ful of paine &amp; anguish vntill his return againe: at
which time hee doth so benumme the same, that though it be pierced with
any sharpe instrument, yet is without any sence of feeling, and will not
yeeld one droppe of bloud at all: a matter knowne by iust, often, and
due triall.</p>

<p>And for the most part, hee bringeth these his slaues and vassailes
obliged to him as his owne, to some desperate, Tragicall,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag2h" href = "#note2h">h</a> and disastrous end; and that
either by the execution of Iustice for their demerits, or by laying
violent hands vpon themselues, or else God powreth vpon them some
strange and extraordinary vengeance, or their Grand-maister whom they
haue serued, dispatcheth them in such manner, as they become dreadfull
and terrible spectacles to the beholders, whereof Histories will furnish
vs with <a class = "tag" name = "tag2i" href = "#note2i">i</a>varietie
and plenty of examples: For the Diuell is a murthering spirit, desirous
to doe mischiefe, swelling in pride, malitious in hatred, spitefull in
enuy, subtill in craft; and therefore it behoueth euery one resolutely
to withstand his assaults, <i>Ephes. 4. 27.</i> and cautelously to
decline his subtilties, and
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
cunning ambushments
<span class = "sidenote">
<span class = "greek" title = "methodeiai">μεθοδείαι</span>
</span>
from whence he inuadeth vs, <i>Eph. 6. 11.</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag2k" href = "#note2k">k</a> For this aduersary against whom we fight,
is an old beaten enemy, sixe thousand yeares are fully compleat since
the first time hee began to assault mankinde. But if any keepe the
Commandements of God, and constantly, by a liuely faith, cleaue fast
vnto Christ, he shall ouercome: for our Lord is inuincible.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag2l" href = "#note2l">l</a> The Diuels indeed doe
willingly offer themselues to be seene of those who are not gouerned by
the Holy Ghost; and that either to win themselues some estimation, or to
intangle and deceiue men, vailing their treacheries vnder a smiling
countenance, whom they deadly hate, for if it lay in their possibilitie,
they would ouerthrow and destroy heauen it selfe. Now vnable to do this,
they endeuour to worke vpon a more weake subiect and matter; and
therefore hee that will not bee subdued of them, must auoid all
occasions whereby he may take any aduantage, and couered with the
Breast-plate of Righteousnesse, and defended with the Shield of Faith,
quench all his fiery Darts. <i>Ephes. 6.&nbsp;14.</i></p>

<h3>The third Proposition.</h3>
<hr>

<p><span class = "firstletter">E</span>Xcept
God do by his especial grace and ouerruling power, restraine the malice
of these Witches and preserue his Children, they are permissiuely
able,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3a" href = "#note3a">a</a> through the

<span class = "folionum">D</span>
their maister, to hurt Men and Beasts, and trouble the elements, by
vertue of that contract &amp; agreement which they haue made with him.
For man they endamage both in body &amp; mind: In body, for <a class =
"tag" name = "tag3b" href = "#note3b">b</a><i>Daneus</i> reporteth of
his owne knowledge, as an eye-witnesse thereof, that he hath seene the
breasts of Nurces (onely touched by their hands) those sacred fountaines
of humane nourishment so dried vp that they could yeeld no milke; some
suddenly tormented with extreame and intolerable paine of the Cholicke,
others<a class = "tag" name = "tag3c" href = "#note3c">c</a> oppressed
with the Palsie, Leprosie, Gout, Apoplexie, &amp;c. And thus disabled
from the performance of any action, many tortured with lingring
consumptions,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3d" href = "#note3d">d</a> and
not a few afflicted with such diseases, which neither they themselues
who wrought that euill, could afterward helpe; nor be cured thereof by
the Art and diligent attendance of most skilfull Physitians. I willingly
let passe other mischiefes wrought by them, of which many things are
deliuered in the Canon and Ciuill Lawes, in the Schoole-men, and Diuines
both ancient and moderne.</p>

<p>In minde, stirring vp men to lust, to hatred, to loue, and the like<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3e" href = "#note3e">e</a> passions, and that
by altering the inward and outward sences, either in forming some new
obiect, or offering the same to the eye
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
or eare, or stirring the humors: for there being a neere coniunction
betweene the sensitiue and rationall faculties of the soule, if the one
bee affected, the other (though indirectly) must of necessity be also
moued. As for example, when they would prouoke any to loue or hatred,
they propound an obiect vnder the shew and appearance of that which is
good and beautifull, so that it may be desired and embraced: or else by
representation of that which is euill &amp; infamous, procure dislike
and detestation. Neither is this any strange position, or improbable,
but may bee warranted by sufficient authority; and therefore <a class =
"tag" name = "tag3f" href = "#note3f">f</a><i>Constantius</i> the
Emperour doth expressely determine, all those iustly punishable who
sollicite by enchantments chaste mindes to vncleannesse: And Saint <a
class = "tag" name = "tag3g" href = "#note3g">g</a><i>Ierome</i>
attributeth vnto them this power, that they can enforce men to hate
those things they should loue, and affect that which they ought to
auoyd: and the ground hereof hath his strength from the holy Scriptures:
for the Diuell is able to enflame wanton<a class = "tag" name = "tag3h"
href = "#note3h">h</a> lust in the heart, and therfore is named, <i>the
Spirit of Fornication</i>, <i>Osea 4. 12.</i> and vncleane, <i>Math.
12.&nbsp;43.</i></p>

<p>There is a very remarkeable example mentioned by <i>Ierome</i><a
class = "tag" name = "tag3i" href = "#note3i">i</a>, of a maiden in
<i>Gaza</i> whom a yong man louing, and not obtaining, went to
<i>Memphis</i> in Egypt, and at the yeares end in his returne, being
there instructed by a Priest of <i>Aesculapius</i>, and furnished with
Magicall Coniurations, graued in a plate of brasse, strange charming
words, and pictures which he buried vnder the threshold
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<span class = "folionum">D2</span>
of the doore where the virgin dwelt: by which meanes she fell into a
fury, pulled off the attire of her head, flung about her haire, gnashed
with her teeth, and continually called vpon the name of her louer.</p>

<p>The like doth <a class = "tag" name = "tag3k" href =
"#note3k">k</a><i>Nazianzene</i> report of <i>Cyprian</i> before his
conuersion (though some thinke it <a class = "tag" name = "tag3l" href =
"#note3l">l</a>was not he whose learned and religions writings are
extant, and for the profession of his faith and doctrine was crowned
with Martyrdome) but another of that name, toward <i>Iustina</i>, whom
hee lasciuiously<a class = "tag" name = "tag3m" href = "#note3m">m</a>
courted, and vnlawfully lusted after. It were easie for me to instance
this in many, and to adde more testimonies, but my intended purpose was,
to set downe onely some few propositions, whereby the iudicious reader
might be stirred vp to a deeper search, and further consideration of
these things: for often they driue men to a madnesse, and other such
desperate passions, that they become murtherers of themselues. But this
alwayes must be kept in minde, as a granted and infallible truth, <a
class = "tag" name = "tag3n" href = "#note3n">n</a>That whatsoeuer the
Witch doth, it receiueth his force from that society which she hath with
the Diuell, who serueth her turne in effecting what she purposeth, and
so they worke together as <a class = "tag" name = "tag3o" href =
"#note3o">o</a>associates.</p>

<p>Now concerning beasts they doe oftentimes kill them out-right, and
that in sundry manner, or pine and waste them by little and little, till
they be consumed.</p>

<p>For <a class = "tag" name = "tag3p" href = "#note3p">p</a>the
Elements, it is an agreeing consent of all, that they can corrupt and
infect them, procure
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
tempests, to stirre vp thunder &amp; lightning, moue violent winds,
destroy the fruits of the earth: for God hath a thousand wayes to
chasten disobedient man, and whole treasures full of vengeance by his
Angels, Diuels, Men, Beasts. For the whole nature of things is ready to
reuenge the wrong done vnto the creator.</p>

<p>It were but fruitlesse labour, and ill spent, to bestow long time in
confirming this so manifest a truth, and not much better then set vp a
candle to giue the Sunnelight when it shineth brightest in mid-heauen:
yet to satisfie those who doubt here-of, I will giue a small touch of an
example or&nbsp;two.</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "tag3q" href = "#note3q">q</a><i>Curius
Sidius</i> the Roman Generall in a battell against <i>Salebus</i>,
Captaine of the <i>Moores</i>, in want of water, obtained such abundance

sufficed the thirst of his <ins class = "correction" title =

Or <i>Hagbert</i>, who could shew herselfe in any shape,

<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<span class = "folionum">D3</span>
mighty Armies haue beene dicomfited, and sundry others, except the truth
hereof were without contradiction approued: by the experience of our
owne Nauigators, who trade in <i>Finland</i>, <i>Denmarke</i>,
<i>Lapland</i>, <i>Ward-house</i>, <i>Norway</i>, and other Countries of
that Climate, and haue obtained of the inhabitants thereof, a certaine
winde for twenty dayes together, or the like fixed period of time,
according to the distance of place and strings tied with three knots, so
that if one were loosed, they should haue a pleasant gale: if the
second, a more vehement blast: if the third, such hideous &amp; raging
tempests that the Mariners were not able once to looke out, to stand
vpon the hatches, to handle their tackle, or to guide the helme with all
their strength; and are somtimes violently carried back to the place
from whence they first loosed to sea; and many (more hardy then wise)
haue bought their triall full deere, opening those knots, and neglecting
admonition giuen to the contrary. <i>Apuleius</i> ascribeth to
<i>Pamphile</i>, a Witch of <i>Thessalia</i>, little lesse then diuine
power to effect strange wonders in heauen, in earth, in hell; to darken
the starres, stay the course of riuers, dissolue mountains, and raise vp
spirits, this opinion went for currant and vncontrouled. And without all
question the Diuell<a class = "tag" name = "tag3s" href =
"#note3s">s</a> can do this and much more, when God letteth him loose.
For he is stiled, <i>The Prince of the world</i>, <i>Ioh. 12. 31</i>.
<i>A strong man armed</i>, <i>Luke 11. 21</i>, <i>Principality</i>, <i>a
ruler of darknesse</i>, <i>spirituall wickednesse in high places</i>,
<i>Ephes. 6. 12</i>.</p>

<p>Thus he dismaied the heart of <i>Saul</i> (when he had
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
broken the Commandement of God) with dreadfull feare, and enraged his
minde with bloudy fury, <i>1. Sam. 16. 14</i>. Entred into <i>Iudas</i>,
prouoked him to betray his maister, dispaire and hang himselfe, <i>Math.
27. 3.</i> filled the heart of <i>Ananias</i> and <i>Saphira</i> with
dissimulation,<i>Act. 5. 3.</i> possessed the bodies of many really, as
is manifest in the History of the Gospell. Our Sauiour Christ assureth
vs, that a daughter of <i>Abraham</i> was bound for 18 yeares by Sathan,
with such a spirit of infirmitie, as bowed together, shee could in no
wise lift vp herselfe, <i>Luk. 13. 11.16</i>. He spake out of the
<i>Pythonesse</i>, <i>Act. 16. 17.</i> brought downe fire from heauen,
and consumed <i>Iobs</i> sheepe 7000. and his seruants, raised a storme,
strooke the house wherein his sonnes and daughters feasted with their
elder brother, smote the foure corners of it, with the ruine whereof
they all were destroyed, and perished: and ouerspread the body of that
holy Saint their father with botches<a class = "tag" name = "tag3t" href
= "#note3t">t</a> and biles from the sole of his foot to the crowne of
his head.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3u" href = "#note3u">u</a> And hee
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
wil haue his seruants Wisards &amp; Witches, coadiutors with him, and
maketh them fit instruments to the performance of all wicked exploits,
and this is when God pleaseth (of which I shall haue occasion to speake
more afterward) to giue leaue, for his wil is the first supreme and
principal cause of all things: and nothing can be done visibly in this
Common-wealth here below of the creatures, but is decreed and determined
so to be first in the high Court of Heauen, according to his
vnsearchable wisedome and iustice, disposing punishments and rewards as
seemeth good vnto himselfe. So <i>Pharaohs</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag3x" href = "#note3x">x</a> Magitians could turne water into bloud,
their roddes into serpents, produce frogges, &amp;c. But when it came to
the base vermine, to make lice, they were pusled, and acknowledged their
imbecillity, confessing, <i>Digitus Dei est</i>,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag3y" href = "#note3y">y</a> Gods finger is here, <i>Exod. 18. 19</i>.
For if they could effect and bring to passe all mischieuous designements
without his sufferance, it would inferre a weakenesse, and conclude a
defect of<a class = "tag" name = "tag3z" href = "#note3z">z</a> power in
him, as not sufficient to oppose their strength, supplant their force,
and auoid their stratagems. And we must not imagine that the practioners
of these damnable Arts of which sexe soeuer, be they men or women, do
performe those mischifes which they effect, by their owne skills or such
meanes as they vse, of which sort bee the bones of dead mens skuls,
Toades, Characters, Images, &amp;c. But <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads 'thorugh'">through</ins> the cooperation of the Diuell,
who is by nature subtile, by long experience instructed, swift to
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
produceth strange works, &amp; to humane vnderstanding admirable. Yet<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3aa" href = "#note3aa">aa</a> he will haue
those his vassals perswaded of some great benefit bestowed vpon them,
whereby they are inabled to helpe and hurt, whom, how, and when they
list; and all to indeere them, &amp; by making them partakers in his
villany, being strongly bound in his seruice, &amp; stedfastly continued
in the same, might more grieuously offend God, and bring iust
condemnation vpon themselues. And for the greater, and more forceable
inticing allurement hereunto, hee promiseth to giue and doe many things
for their sakes, and reueale to them hidden secrets, and future euents,
such<a class = "tag" name = "tag3bb" href = "#note3bb">bb</a> as he
himselfe purposeth to doe, or knoweth by naturall signes shall come to
passe. So then to conclude, in<a class = "tag" name = "tag3cc" href =
"#note3cc">cc</a> euery Magicall action, there must be a concurrence of
these three. First, the permitting will of God. Secondly, the suggestion
of the Diuell, and his power cooperating. Thirdly, the desire and
consent of the Sorcerer; and if<a class = "tag" name = "tag3dd" href =
"#note3dd">dd</a> any of these be wanting, no trick of witch-craft can
be performed. For if God did not suffer it, neither the Diuell, nor the
Witch could preuaile to do any thing, no not so much as to hurt one<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3ee" href = "#note3ee">ee</a> bristle of a
Swine. And if the Diuell had not seduced the minde of the wicked woman,
no such matter would haue beene attempted. And againe, if hee had not
the Witch to bee his instrument, the Diuell were debarred of his
purpose.</p>

<p>And as these euill spirits are in themselues different in power,
vnderstanding, and subtiltie: so
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<span class = "folionum">E</span>
can their seruants do more or lesse through their meanes.</p>

<p>I conclude with that memorable speech of a most noble and learned
man,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3ff" href = "#note3ff">ff</a> The Diuell
is the Author and principall of all that euill which the Witch or Wisard
committeth, not thereby to make them more powerfull, but to deceiue them
by credulity and ouer-light beliefe, and to get himselfe a companion of
his impiety, cruelty, and hatred, which he beareth both to God and man;
and also of eternall damnation: for indeed it is his worke, which the
foolish and doating wisards coniecture is brought to passe by the words
and inchantments which they vtter: and is very busie thus to colour his
proceedings, which neuer come abroad in their owne likenesse, because he
enuieth the blessed estate of man, and his eternall saluation purchased
by the perfect obedience of Christ the Redeemer, and hateth that Image
of God which hee beholdeth in him; much like the Panther,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3gg" href = "#note3gg">gg</a> who when hee cannot get
hold of the man himselfe, is so inflamed with rage, that he teareth his
picture in peeces violently which is cast vpon the ground to hinder his
pursuit of the hunter who hath carried away his whelpes. And <a class =
"tag" name = "tag3hh" href = "#note3hh">hh</a>so as <i>Lactantius</i>
speaketh, these vncleane spirits cast from heauen, wander vp and downe
the earth, compasse land and sea, seeking to bring men to destruction as

<h3>The fourth Proposition.</h3>
<hr>

<p><span class = "firstletter">H</span>Auing shewed before, that the
pracise of Witches receiueth the being and perfection from that<a class
= "tag" name = "tag4a" href = "#note4a">a</a> agreement which is made
betweene them and Diuell, it now followeth necessarily, that we do
enquire whether it bee possible that there may be any such agreement and
league betweene them. The cause of doubt ariseth from the diuersity or
disparity of their natures, the one being a corporall substance, the
other spirituall, vpon which ground some<a class = "tag" name = "tag4b"
href = "#note4b">b</a> haue supposed that no such contract can passe:
But we are to hold the contrary affirmatiue, both <i>de esse</i>, and
<i>de posse</i>, <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads 'that that'">that</ins> there may be,
and is, notwithstanding this difference
of essence, a mutuall contract of the one with the other: for we read of
sundry leagues between God &amp; his people, and some with great
solemnitie of ceremonies vsed in the same, a<a class = "tag" name =
"tag4c" href = "#note4c">c</a> <i>Genesis 15. 9.17.</i> and <i>Deut. 5.
2.</i> and in many other like places, yet is hee a simple essence,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag4d" href = "#note4d">d</a> free from all
diuision, multiplication, composition, accidents, incorporeall,
spirituall, and inuisible. But in Angelicall creatures, though there be
no Physicall composition of matter and forme, or a soule and a body; yet
is there a metaphysicall, being substances consisting of an act and
possibility, subiect and accidents. And furthcr, betweene a spirit and a
man, there is communication of the
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<span class = "folionum">E2</span>
vnderstanding and will, the faculties and actions whereof must concurre
in euery couenant, which is nothing else but the consent of two or more
persons about the thing.</p>

<p>And when the Diuell durst in expresse tearmes tender a contract to
our blessed Sauiour, tempting him in the wildernesse, shewing him the
kingdomes of the world, and the glory thereof, offered them with this
condition, <i>All these will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and
worship me</i>, <i>Mat. 4. 9</i>. How much more then will hee aduenture
vpon man, weake, wicked, and easie to be seduced? And who<a class =
"tag" name = "tag4e" href = "#note4e">e</a> can doubt but that these bee
the solemne and formall words of a bargaine, <i>Do vt des, do vt
facias</i>, I giue this for to haue that giuen, I bestow this, to haue
such, or such a thing done for&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Now this couenant is of two sorts, secret or manifest; secret, when
one indeuoureth or intendeth to do any thing by such meanes, which
neither in nature, nor by institution haue power to produce the purposed
effects, or be conioyned as neccessary with other, which can bring the
same to passe. Expresse, wherein consent is giuen either by writing, and
words, or making such signes, whereby they renounce God, and deuote
themselues slaues and vassals vnto the Diuell, hee promising, that vpon
such condition they shall doe wonders, know future euents, helpe and
hurt at their pleasure, and others like vnto these.</p>

<p>An example whereof wee may obserue in<a class = "tag" name = "tag4f"
href = "#note4f">f</a> <i>Siluester</i> the second, one of the holy
Fathers of
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<i>Rome</i>, who did homage to the Diuell his Lord, and made fidelity to
liue at his will and appoyntment, vpon condition to obtaine what he
desired, by which meanes he got first the Bishopricke of <i>Rhemes</i>,
after of <i>Rauenna</i>, and at the last the Papacie of <i>Rome</i>.
Which Sea, though it will yeeld good plenty of such like presidents, and
we may finde them in authenticall records of Histories, yet I content my
selfe with this&nbsp;one.</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "tag4g" href = "#note4g">g</a>The formall
tearmes of this couenant, as they bee set downe by some, are most
dreadfull: and the seuerall poynts these.</p>

<p>To renounce God his Creator, and that promise made in Baptisme.</p>

<p>To deny Iesus Christ, and refuse the benefites of his obedience, yea
to blaspheme his glorious and holy name.</p>

<p>To worship the Deuill, &amp; repose all confidence and trust
in&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>To execute his commaundements.</p>

<p>To vse things created of God for no end, but to the hurt and
destruction of others.</p>

<p>And lastly, to giue himselfe soule and body to that deceitfull and
infernall spirit, who on the other part appeareth to them in the shape
of a man (which is most common) or some other creature, conferreth
familiarly, and bindeth himselfe by many promises, that at all times
called for, he will presently come, giue counsell, further their
desires, answer any demaund, deliuer from prison, and out of all
dangers, bestow riches, wealth, pleasure, and what not? and all without
any labour and
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<span class = "folionum">E3</span>
paines-taking, in a word to become seruiceable to their will, &amp;
accomplish all their requests. And this is that which the Prophet
<i>Esay</i> speaketh, <i>chap. 28. 15.</i> to make a couenant with
death, and an agreement with hell. The consent of the ancient Fathers,
if there were any doubt, might be added to the further clearing of this
conclusion. For <a class = "tag" name = "tag4h" href =
"#note4h">h</a><i>Cyprian</i> directly affirmeth, that all those who vse
magicall Arts, make a couenant with the Diuell, yea he himselfe, while
he practized the same (before his calling to the light and true
knowledge of God) was bound vnto him by an especiall<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4i" href = "#note4i">i</a> writing, whereunto some subscribe
with their owne bloud, which was a vse among diuers nations, and a most
sure bond of constant friendship, and <a class = "tag" name = "tag4k"
href = "#note4k">k</a>inuiolable consociation. But herein these seduced
wretches are deceiued: for these promises which he makes, are
treacherous, and the obseruances whereunto he enioyneth and perswadeth
them, as powerfull in producing such or such effects, meere deceipts,
and haue no qualitie in them to that purpose, but respecteth his owne
ends, which are one of these foure.</p>

<p>First, to the mouing of them to the breaking of Gods&nbsp;law.</p>

<p>Secondly, to adore him with diuine worship and sacred rites.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to weaken their hope and faith in&nbsp;God.</p>

<p>Fourthly, to couer his owne fraud and treachery, that it may not be
perceiued.</p>

<p>And when they finde this Impostor failing in the performance of his
vowed promises, then he
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
wanteth not his shifts: as that these defects are not to be imputed to
him, or the weakenesse of the Art, but their owne negligence or
ignorance, who haue not exactly obserued such directions, and in that
manner they were deliuered: or mistooke his meaning, which is commonly
deliuered in<a class = "tag" name = "tag4l" href = "#note4l">l</a>
ambiguous tearmes, such as will admit a double construction: and herein
appeareth the lamentable and woefull blindnesse of man, who is contented
to swallow vp, and excuse many of his lies by one truth fore-told; which
hath casually come to passe, whereas in other matters they make light
account of, yea cõtemne infinit truths, if they shall finde by long
search and diligent inquiry, but one falshood. Wherefore it behooueth vs
to be carefull Centinels ouer our selues, for that our grand<a class =
"tag" name = "tag4m" href = "#note4m">m</a> aduersary, proud, enuious,
and not standing in the truth, reposeth all his possibility of victory
in lies, and out of this poysoned sinke, deuiseth all kinde of deceits,
that so hee might depriue man of that happy and blessed estate which he
lost by pride, and draw him into the society of his owne damnation:
therefore it is a needfull caueat giuen by one of the ancient Fathers:
Our enemy is old against whom wee
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
fight, sixe <a class = "tag" name = "tag4n" href =
"#note4n">n</a>thousand yeares fully compleat are passed since he began
to oppose himself against vs; but if wee obserue the commandements of
God, and continue steadfast in faith, apprehending Iesus Christ, then
shall we be able to withstand all his violent assaults, and ouer-come
him because Christ in whom we trust, is inuincible.</p>

those who haue submitted themselues vnto him, and are bound to his

continued in him whole<a class = "tag" name = "tag5c" href =

obedience and holiness wherein they were created, from whence a reason
confirmatiue may bee thus framed, Good Angels can take vnto themselues
bodies, as <i>Genes. 18. 2.</i> <i>Iudg. 13. 3.6.</i> therefore the
euill also. Thus the Diuell hath appeared to some in the forme of a <a
class = "tag" name = "tag5d" href = "#note5d">d</a>Man, cloathed in
purple, &amp; wearing a crowne vpon his head: to others in the likenesse
of a <a class = "tag" name = "tag5e" href = "#note5e">e</a>Childe:
sometime he sheweth himselfe in the
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
forme of foure-footed beastes, foules, creeping things, <a class = "tag"
name = "tag5f" href = "#note5f">f</a>roaring as a Lyon, skipping like a
Goat, barking after the manner of a dogge, and the like. But<a class =
"tag" name = "tag5g" href = "#note5g">g</a> it is obserued by some, that
he cannot take the shape of a Sheepe, or Doue, though of an Angell of
light: <i>2. Cor. 11. 14</i>. And further, <a class = "tag" name =
"tag5h" href = "#note5h">h</a>most of the learned doe hold, that those
bodies wherein they doe appeare, are fashioned of the<a class = "tag"
name = "tag5i" href = "#note5i">i</a> aire, (though it is not to be
denied, but they can enter into other, as the Diuell did into the
Serpent, deceiuing <i>Eue</i>, <i>Gen. 3. 1.</i>) which if it continuing
pure and in the owne nature,<a class = "tag" name = "tag5k" href =
"#note5k">k</a> hath neither colour nor figure, yet condensed receiueth
both, as wee may behold in the clouds, which resemble sometime one,
sometime another shape, and so in them is seene the representation of
Armies fighting, of beasts and Birds, houses, Cities, and sundry other
kinds of apparations.</p>

<p>Histories of all can witnesse of the Diuels appearance in human<a
class = "tag" name = "tag5l" href = "#note5l">l</a> shape: thus a
<i>Pseudo-Moses</i>, or <i>Messias</i> in <i>Crete</i>, perswaded the
Iewes that it was he who brought their Fathers the Israelites out of
Egypt, and led them through the Red Sea, and would conduct them also out
of that land vpon the waters into <i>Iudea</i>. But many following his
counsell, perished: the rest admonished by that destruction, turned
back, accusing their folly; and when they made enquiry for this guide,
to haue rewarded him according to his desert, was no where to be found,
whereof they conceiued hee was a Diuell in Mans likenesse. And such an
one <a class = "tag" name = "tag5m" href = "#note5m">m</a>was that merry
(but malicious) spirit, who walked
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<span class = "folionum">F</span>
for a long time in Saxony, and was very seruiceable, clothed in country
apparrell, with a cappe on his head, delighted to conuerse and talke
with the people, to demaund questions, and answer what he was asked,
hurting none, except iniured before, and then declared himselfe a right
diuell in reuenge.</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "tag5n" href = "#note5n">n</a>The late
Discoueries and Nauigations made into the west Indies, can furnish vs
with abundant testimonies hereof, in which the mindes of the inhabitants
are both terrified &amp; their bodies massacred by his visible sight,
and cruell tortures; yet (which is the opinion of many learned) he
cannot so perfectly represent the fashion of a mans body, but that there
is some sensible deformity, by which hee bewrayeth himselfe; as his <a
class = "tag" name = "tag5o" href = "#note5o">o</a>feete like those of
an Ox, a Horse, or some other beasts, clouen houed, his hands crooked,
armed with clawes, or talants like a vulture: or some one misshapen
part, wherein (though hee delight in the shape of man, as most fitting
for company and conference) is demonstrated, the great and tender loue
of God toward vs, who hath so branded this deceiuer, that hee may bee
discerned euen of those who are but of meane capacity, and so
consequently auoyded. And as in his body assumed, so in his speech there
is a defect, for it is weake, small, whispering, imperfect.</p>

<p>And thus it is <a class = "tag" name = "tag5p" href =
"#note5p">p</a>reported of <i>Hermolaus Barbarus</i>, who inquiring of a
spirite, the signification and meaning of a difficult <a class = "tag"

<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
he hard a low hissing, and murmuring voyce giuing answere.</p>

<p>And this hee doth of set purpose, that so his sophisticall &amp;
doubtfull words might be the lesse perceiued.</p>

<p>Neither can this seeme strange to any, that the Diuell should speake,
who brought a voyce from Trees to salute<a class = "tag" name = "tag5r"
href = "#note5r">r</a> <i>Apollonius</i>, and inspired that talkatiue
Oke in <i>Dodona</i>, famous for the Oracles vttered there in Heroicall
verse, to the Grecians, and to euery nation in his owne language,
Chaldeans, Egyptians, Armenians, and other people who were led by him,
and depended vpon his resolution.</p>

<p>And thus the <a class = "tag" name = "tag5s" href =
"#note5s">s</a>Image of <i>Memnon</i>, when the Sunne did shine vpon it,
and his beames touched the lips thereof, (which was at the arising in
the East) speake vnto them who were present.</p>

<p>And considering, as hath beene mentioned before, that there passeth
betweene the Witch and her Diuell, a compact, as with a Maister and a
Seruant, it must therefore consist vppon prescript tearmes of
commaunding, and obeying; and then of necessity is required a conuersing
together; and conference whereby the same couenant may be ratified.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">G</span>Od
giueth, both the diuell, and his seruants the witches, power sometimes
to trouble his owne children; so <a class = "tag" name = "tag6a" href =
"#note6a">a</a>Christ our blessed Sauiour, was by Sathan carryed from
place to place, <i>Math. 4. 5</i>. <i>Iob</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag6b" href = "#note6b">b</a> in strange manner afflicted, and his
children slaine, through his power, whom none can conceiue but were Gods
seruants, religiously brought vp in his feare: and their father hath an
honourable testimonie from the mouth of God himselfe, <i>Iob 1. ver.
8</i>. <i>Dauid</i>, a man according to Gods owne heart, <i>Acts 13.
22.</i> is by Sathan stirred vp to number the people, <i>1. Chron. 21.
1.</i> and that incuriosity and the pride of his heart, onelie to know
the multitude of his subiects, <i>2. Sam. 24.&nbsp;2.</i></p>

<p>Whereas the Law appoynteth another end, <i>Exod. 30. 12.</i> which
hee had <a class = "tag" name = "tag6c" href = "#note6c">c</a>now
forgotten, the maintenance of the Ministerie and worshippe of God. And a
daughter of <i>Abraham</i> is bound of the diuell eighteene whole
yeeres, had a spirit of Infirmity, was bowed together, and could in no
wise lift vp herselfe, <i>Lu. 13. 11.16.</i> a grieuous calamity in
respect of the author, the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads 'coutinuance'">continuance</ins>,
and the effect. But to handle this
poynt a little more distinctly; It shall not be amisse to open first
some reasons, why God doth giue this power to the diuel ouer the
righteous his children sometimes, as also vpon the wicked and
disobedient to
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
his will: And in the second place, why Witches haue the like leaue
graunted vnto them. Therefore for his children.</p>

<p>The first reason of his permission is his inscrutable<a class = "tag"
name = "tag6d" href = "#note6d">d</a> wisedome, who out of euill
bringeth good; so <i>Paul</i> had a minister of Sathan to buffet him, to
keepe him in humility, that hee might not waxe proude and high-minded,
in regard of those great mysteries which were reuealed when hee was
taken into the third heauen, <i>2. Corint. 12. 4</i>. Thus his tentation
was a medicine preseruatiue preuenting the disease of his soule, which
otherwise hee might haue falne into, <a class = "tag" name = "tag6e"
href = "#note6e">e</a>for both himselfe, and the rest of the Apostles,
though they were chosen vessells, yet were they also fraile and brittle,
wandring yet in the flesh vpon earth, not triumphing securely in
heauen.</p>

<p>Second, It is<a class = "tag" name = "tag6f" href = "#note6f">f</a>
proceeding from his mercy and goodnes, for the trial of faith, obedience
and constancy in such as belong to God: whereof there is an excellent
patterne, and vnparaleld in <i>Iob 1. 13.14.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i> for by
this triall is made a proofe to examine whether wee doe continue firme
vpon our square, and vnshaken, or no; and be not remoued, eyther by the
<a class = "tag" name = "tag6g" href = "#note6g">g</a>seeming wonders of
the diuell, or of his seruants and associats. And therefore the Apostle
pronounceth him blessed, who endureth temptation, for when hee is tryed
hee shall receiue the crowne of life, which the Lord hath promised to
them that loue him, <i>Iames 1. 12.</i> for he is faithfull, and wil not
suffer vs to be tempted aboue that we are able, but with the temptation
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<span class = "folionum">F3</span>
also make a way to escape, &amp;c. <i>1. Cor. 10. 13</i>.</p>

<p>Third, Wee are admonished alwayes to stand in a readines, and be
armed for to fight, prepared to withstand the diuell, knowing that God
doth oftentimes giue him leaue to assault vs. Therefore we haue need to
be furnished in all points, for we wrastle not against flesh and blood,
but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
darkenesse of this world, against spirituall wickednesses in high
places, <i>Ephes. 6. 11.12</i>. And <i>1. Pet. 5. 8.9.</i> be sober and
vigilant, because your aduersary the diuell as a roaring Lyon walketh
about, seeking whom he may deuoure. He <a class = "tag" name = "tag6h"
href = "#note6h">h</a>is no weake assaylant, and therefore heere by the
Apostle are noted in him foure things: First, his power (a Lyon):
Second, his hatred, and wrath in the word (roaring): Third, his subtilty
(walking about) obseruing euery oportunity and occasion to hurt vs:
Fourth, his cruelty (deuoure) no contentment but in our ruine and vtter
destruction.</p>

<p>Fourth, God would haue vs get the victorie against Sathan, and take
knowledge, that Christ on our side fighteth for vs, through whom we
triumph, and so are made more vndoubtedly assured of our saluation; and
this is that which hee promised, <i>The <a class = "tag" name = "tag6i"
href = "#note6i">i</a>Seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the
Serpent</i>, <i>Gen. 3. 15</i>. And the Apostle confirmeth, God shall
tread down Sathan vnder your feete, <i>Rom. 16. 20</i>.</p>

<p>God suffereth the diuell to preuaile against the wicked, yet in the
most Holy there is no iniustice <i>2. Chron. 19. 7</i>. But
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
First, <a class = "tag" name = "tag6k" href = "#note6k">k</a>Herein is
the declaration of his iustice, whereby hee punisheth obstinate sinners,
&amp; those who prouoke him to wrath, and will not repent: And thus it
is sayd of the <i>Aegiptians</i>, whom no plagues could soften, that hee
cast vpon them the fiercenes of his anger, and indignation, and trouble,
by sending euill Angels among them, <a class = "tag" name = "tag6l" href
= "#note6l">l</a><i>Psalm 78. 49</i>. And when <i>Saul</i> had neglected
the commandement of God, an euill spirit from the Lord troubled him,
<i>1. Sam. 16. 14</i>. Thus <i>Ahab</i> seduced by his false prophets
descendeth into the battaile, and is slaine (contemning the words of
<i>Michaiah</i>) in<a class = "tag" name = "tag6m" href =
"#note6m">m</a> whose mouthes the diuell was a lying spirit, who sent of
the Lord, perswaded him and preuailed, <i>1. Kin. 22. 22.23.24</i>.</p>

<p>Second, By affliction in the body or goodes, God<a class = "tag" name
= "tag6n" href = "#note6n">n</a> would quicken them vp to seeke the
saluation of their soules. And so <i>Paul</i> gaue ouer a scandalous and
incestuous person vnto the diuell, that he might be induced to forsake
his sin, liue chastely heereafter, and be an edifying example to those
whom he had offended: and this kinde of discipline was more soueraigne,
then any other could haue beene, because mans nature abhorreth Sathan,
and trembleth with feare once to conceiue that he should fall into his
power and hands, and this is that which he writeth, aduising the
Corinthians to deliuer him vnto Sathan, for the destruction of the
flesh, that the spirit may be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus, <i>1.
Cor 5. 5</i>. And in this sort he speaketh of two other deceiuers and
blasphemers, <i>Hymenaus</i> and <i>Alexander</i>, I haue deliuered
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
them vnto Sathan, that they may learne not to blaspheme, <i>1. Timothie
1. 20.</i> therfore this giuing ouer, was not to destruction, but for
correction.</p>

<p>The last poynt propounded, was, That witches haue power granted to
vex Gods owne children aswell as others, and preuaile ouer them; and
that we doe enquire (so farre as we may, and is iustifiable) of the
causes thereof, which may be these.</p>

<p>First, <a class = "tag" name = "tag6o" href = "#note6o">o</a>This is
permitted vnto them for the experience of their faith and integrity, so
that by this meanes their loue towards God which lay hidden in the
heart, is now made manifest. To be quiet and patient in prosperity, when
we may enioy benefites at our owne pleasure, is a matter easily to be
performed: But to endure the fire of Tribulation, that is the proofe of
a stedfast Christian, and in losses and sickenesse procured by such to
bee silent, and submit our selues, this is the note of a faithfull man,
&amp; to choose rather obeying the law of God, to beare the infirmity of
the body, then to ouer-flow in riches, and enioying health and strength
offend the Lord.</p>

<p>Second, this maketh a difference betweene the wicked and the godly:
for thus the holy Apostle speaketh of the righteous, that by many
afflictions they must enter into the kingdome of heauen, <i>Act. 14.
22</i>. And all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus suffer
tribulations, <i>2. Timoth. 3. 12.</i> for whom the Lord loueth, he doth
chasten, <i>Prouer. 3. 12</i>. It is a Christians glory to vndergoe for
Gods cause, any vexation whatsoeuer, whether wrought by the
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
diuell, or brought to passe by wicked men his <a class = "tag" name =
"tag6p" href = "#note6p">p</a>instruments; for when he is tryed, hee
shall receiue the crowne of life, which God hath promised to those who
loue him, <i>Iames 1. 12</i>. But wee reade contrary of the wicked, they
become olde, yea, are mighty in power, their seede is established in
their sight with them, and their of-spring before their eyes, their
houses are safe from feare, neyther is the rod of God vpon them, &amp;c.
they spend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment go downe into the
graue, <i>Iob 21. 7.8.9.</i> &amp;c. Yet surely they are set in slippery
places, sodainely destroyed and perished, &amp; horribly consumed as a
dreame when one awaketh: O Lord, thou shalt make their Image despised,
&amp;c. <i>Psal. 73. 18.19.20</i>.</p>

women in a farre different proportion prooue Witches then men, by a
hundred to one; therefore the Lawe of God noteth that Sex, as more
subiect to that sinne, <i>Exodus 22. 18</i>. It is a common speach
amongst the Iewish Rabbins, <a class = "tag" name = "tag7a" href =
"#note7a">a</a>many women, many Witches: And it should seeme that this
was a generally receiued opinion, for so it is noted by <i>Pliny</i>,
<i>Quintilian</i>, and others, neyther doth this proceede (as some haue
thought) from their frailtie and imbecillity, for in many of them there
is stronger resolution, to vndergoe any torment then can bee found in
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<span class = "folionum">G</span>
man, as was made apparant in that conspiracy of <i>Piso</i> against
<i>Nero</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag7b" href = "#note7b">b</a> who

</span>
imagining that being a woman, she would neuer bee able to ouercome the
paine: But all the tortures that he or his could deuise, were not able
to draw from her the least confession of any thing that was then
obiected against her. The first dayes question shee so vtterly
contemned, that the very Chaire in which they conueied her from the
place, did seeme as a Chariot wherein shee rid, triumphing ouer the
barbarous vsage of their inhumane cruelty. The morrow following brought
thither againe, after many rough incounters, remained so vnshaken, that
wrath it selfe grew madde, to see the strokes of an obstinate and
relenting fury fall so in vaine vpon the softer temper of a Woman: and
at the last tooke a scarfe from about her necke, and by it knits vp
within her bosome the knowledge shee had of that fact, together with
that little remainder of spirit, whereof by force and violence they
laboured to depriue&nbsp;her.</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "tag7c" href = "#note7c">c</a>Former ages
haue likewise produced <i>Leena</i>, an exemplary president of this
sort, to all posterity, who when <i>Armodius</i> and <i>Aristogiton</i>
hauing failed of the execution of their enterprise against
<i>Hipparchus</i> a tyrant, had beene put to death, she was brought to
the torture to be enforced to declare what other complices there were of
the conspiracie. But rather then shee
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
should bee compelled thereunto, bit her tongue asunder, and spit it in
the face of the tyrant, that though she would, yet could not now
disclose them. In remembrance whereof the Athenians caused a Lyon of
Brasse to bee erected, shewing her inuincible courage by the generosity
of that beast, and her perseuerance in secrecie, in that they made it
without a tongue. Therefore the learned haue searched out other causes
thereof, and among the rest, obserued these as the most probable.</p>

<p>First, they are by nature credulous, wanting experience, and therfore
more easily deceiued.</p>

<p>Secondly, <a class = "tag" name = "tag7d" href = "#note7d">d</a>they
harbour in their breast a curious and inquisitiue desire to know such
things as be not fitting and <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads 'couenient'">conuenient</ins>,
and so are oftentimes intangled
with the bare shew and visard of goodnesse. As the Lady of Rome, who was
importune, and vehemently instant vpon her husband, to know what was
debated of that day at the Councell Table. And when he could not be at
rest, answered, The Priests had seene a Larke flying in the aire with a
golden Helmet on his head, and holding a speare in his foot. Scarce she
had this, but presently she told it to one of her maids: she to another
of her fellowes, so that report was spread through the whole Citie, and
went for currant vntill it receiued a checke: But all are not of this
mould.</p>

<p>Thirdly, their complection is softer, and from hence more easily
receiue the impressions offered by the Diuell; as when they be
instructed and
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
gouerned by good Angels, they proue exceeding religious, and
extraordinarily deuout; so consenting to the suggestions of euill
spirits, become notoriously wicked, so that there is no mischiefe aboue
that of a woman, <i>Eccles. 25. 13.</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p>Fourthly, in them is a greater facility to fall, and therefore the
Diuell at the first took that aduantage, and set vpon <i>Eue</i> in
<i>Adams</i> absence, <i>Genes. 3. 3</i>.</p>

<p>Fifthly, this sex, when it conceiueth wrath or hatred against any, is
vnplacable, possessed with vnsatiable desire of reuenge, and transported
with appetite to right (as they thinke) the wrongs offered vnto them:
and when their power herein answereth not their will, and are meditating
with themselues how to effect their mischieuous proiects and designes,
the Diuell<a class = "tag" name = "tag7e" href = "#note7e">e</a> taketh
the occasion, who knoweth in what manner to content exulcerated mindes,
windeth himselfe into their hearts, offereth to teach them the meanes by
which they may bring to passe that rancor which was nourished in their
breasts, and offereth his helpe and furtherance herein.</p>

<p>Sixthly, they are of a slippery tongue, and full of words: and
therefore if they know any such wicked practises, are not able to hold
them, but communicate the same with their husbands, children, consorts,
and inward acquaintance; who not consideratly weighing what the issue
and end thereof may be, entertaine the same, and so the poyson is
dispersed. Thus <i>Dalilah</i> discouered her husbands strength where it
lay, vnto the <ins class = "correction" title =

<span class = "hidden">M</span><i>Arie</i>
wife of <i>Henrie Smith</i>, Glouer, possessed with a wrathfull
indignation against some of her neighbours, in regard that they made
gaine of their buying and selling Cheese, which shee (vsing the same
trade) could not doe, or they better (at the least in her opinion) then
she did, often times cursed them, and became incensed with vnruly
passions, armed with a setled resolution, to effect some mischieuous
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
proiects and designes against them. The diuell who is skilfull, and
reioyceth of such an occasion offered and knoweth how to stirre vp the
euill affected humours of corrupt mindes (she becomming now a fitte
subject, through this her distemper, to worke vpon, hauing the
vnderstanding darkened with a cloude of passionate, and reuengefull
affections) appeared vnto her amiddes these discontentments,
<span class = "sidenote">
Proposition 4.
</span>
in the shape of a blacke man, and willed that the she should continue in
her malice, enuy, hatred, banning and cursing; and then he would be
reuenged for her vpon all those to whom she willed euill:
<span class = "sidenote">
Proposition 5.
</span>
and this promise was vttered in a lowe murmuring and hissing voyce: and
at that present they entred tearmes of a compact, he requiring that she
should forsake God, and depend vpon him: to which she condescended in
expresse tearmes, renouncing God, and betaking herselfe vnto him. I am
sparing by anie amplification to enlarge this, but doe barely and
nakedly rehearse the trueth, and number of her owne words vnto mee.
After this hee presented himselfe againe at sundry times, and that to
this purpose (as may probably bee coniectured) to hold her still in his
possession, who was not able, eyther to looke further into these
subtilties, then the superficiall barke thereof, or not discouer the
depth of his designements, and in other formes, as of a mist, and of a
ball of fire, with some dispersed spangles of blacke; and at the last in
prison (after the doome of iudegement, and sentence of condemnation was
passed against her) two seuerall

by whose prayers and instructions she might be brought to the sight and
confession of her grieuous offences, be regained and rescued out of his
hands, brought to repentance, and the fauour of God, assured hope of
mercie, and eternall life, and at these times he wished her to confesse
nothing to any of them, but continue constant in her made promise, rely
vpon him, and hee would saue her. This was too high a straine aboue his
reach to haue made it good, and a note of his false descant, who hauing
compassed this wretched woman, brought her to a shamefull and vntimely
end; yet doing nothing herein contrary to his malicious purposes, for
hee was a murtherer from the beginning, <i>Iohn 8. 44</i>.</p>

<h3>¶ Her wicked practise against Iohn Orkton.</h3>

<p>The first who tasted of the gall of her bitternes was <i>Iohn
Orkton</i> a Sailer, and a man of strong constitution of body, who about
some fiue yeares sithence, returning out of Holland in the Netherland,
or low Countries beyond the Seas, hapened, for some misdemeanors
committed by him to strike the sonne of this <i>Mary Smith</i> (but in
such sort as could not in reason bee offensiuely taken) who hearing his
complaint, came forth into the streete, cursing and banning him
therefore, as oftentimes shee did, dwelling in the next adioyning house,
and wished in a most earnest and bitter manner, that his fingers might
rotte off; wherevpon presently hee grew weake, distempered in stomacke,
and could digest no meate, nor other nourishment receiued, and this
discrasie or feeblenesse continued for the space of three quarters of a
yeare; which time expired, the fore-mentioned griefe fel downe from the
stomacke into his hands and feete, so that his fingers did corrupt, and
were cut off; as also his toes putrified &amp; consumed in a very
strange and admirable manner. Neuerthelesse, notwithstanding these
calamities, so long as hee was able, went still to Sea, in the goods and
shippes of sundry Merchants (for it
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<span class = "folionum">H</span>
was his onely meanes of liuing) but neuer could make any prosperous
voyage (as then other men did) eyther beneficiall to the Owners, or
profitable to him selfe. Whereupon, not willing to bee hindrance to
others, and procure no good for his owne maintenance by his labours,
left that trade of life, and kept home, where his former griefe
encreasing, sought to obtaine help and remedie by Chirurgery, and for
this end went to Yarmouth, hoping to be cured by one there, who was
accompted very skilfull: but no medicines applyed by the Rules of Arte
and Experience, wrought any expected or hoped for effect: for both his
hands and feete, which seemed in some measure euery euening to be
healing, in the morning were found to haue gone backeward, and growne
far worse then before: So that the Chirurgian perceiuing his labour to
bee wholly frustrate, gaue ouer the cure, and the diseased patient still
continueth in a most distressed and miserable estate, vnto the which hee
was brought by the hellish practises of this malitious woman, who long
before openly in the streetes, (whenas yet the neighbours knew of no
such thing) reioycing at the calamity, said, <i>Orkton</i> now lyeth a
rotting. And no maruell though she could tell that which herselfe had
done, and her good maister would not suffer to be concealed, but that
the testimony of her owne tongue should remayne as a record towardes her
further detection and condemnation, who sought meanes of her voluntary
accord to be reconciled with the wofull distressed
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
party, but this was nothing else but to plaister ouer and disguise her
former inhumane and barbarous actions, for no reliefe at all followed
thereof: for oftentimes, as hath beene prooued, the
<span class = "sidenote">
Propositiõ 3.
</span>
diuells and witches his instruments doe cause such diseases, which
neyther the one, nor the other can remoue againe. And this is not any
vaporous imagination, but a most vndoubted trueth. For now this poore
man continueth still in a lamentable estate, griefe, and paines
encreasing, without hope of helpe, except God in the abundance of his
tender mercies vouchsafe to grant comfort and deliuerance.</p>


<h3>¶ Her Wicked practise against Elizabeth Hancocke.</h3>

<p>The second person distressed, by this witch, was <i>Elizabeth
Hancocke</i>, then widdow, now wife of <i>Iames Scot</i>: the maner,
occasion, and proceeding of whose dealing against her was thus. She
comming out of the towne from the shoppe of one <i>Simon Browne</i> a
Silkeman, vnto whom she had carried home some worke, which was by him
put out vnto her; <i>Henry Smith</i>, as shee passed by his doore, tooke
her by the hand, and smilingly said, that his ducke (meaning his wife,
this woman of whome we now speake) told him that shee had stolne her
henne; which wordes she then passed
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<span class = "folionum">H2</span>
ouer, as onely spoken in merriment, and denying the same: in the meane
time, as they were interchanging these words, shee came herselfe, and
directly charged her with the henne, and wished that the bones thereof
might sticke in her throat, when she should eate the same: which speech
also she made no great reckoning of, supposing them to be but words of
course, and might bee vttered in jeast. Neuerthelesse, afterward better
considering of the same, conceiued much griefe, to bee counted one of so
euill quality and disposition, and espying that hen for which she was
accused, to sit vpon the hatch of her shoppe doore, went to her, and
mooued with the indignity of that slaunder, and vniust imputation, told
her in some passion and angry manner, that it was a dishonest part thus
to blemish the good name of her neighbors with so vntrue aspersions:
whereupon, breaking foorth in some violence, she wished the pox to light
vpon her, and named her prowde <i>Iinny</i>, prowde flurts, and shaking
the hand, bade her go in, for she should repent it; and the same night,
within three or foure houres after these curses and imprecations
vttered, she was taken and pinched at the heart, and felt a sodaine
weaknesse in all the parts of her body; yet her appetite to meare
nothing diminished, and so continued for the space of three weekes; in
which time, when she was any thing well, would come to the doore, and
leane vpon the stall, whom this <i>Marie Smith</i> seeing, did euer
banne, adding the former curse, the poxe light vpon you, can you yet
come to the doore?
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
and at the end of these three weekes, beeing but very weake, came foorth
as shee vsed to doe, to take the ayre, this mischieuous woman most
bitterly cursed her againe, whereupon she went into the house, fell into
such a torturing fit, and nipping at the heart, that she fainted, hardly
recouerable for the space of halfe an houre, and so grieuously racked
and tormented through all parts of her body, as if the very flesh had
beene torne from the bones, by the violent paine whereof she could not
refraine, but tore the haire from off her head, and became as one
distraught, bereaued of sence, and vnderstanding: And the same night the
bed whereon she lay, was so tossed, and lifted vp and downe, both in her
owne feeling, and in the sight of others then present beholders of her
extreamities, by the space of one houre or more, that she was therewith
exceedingly terrified, &amp; did thinke oftentimes in her sleepe, that
she did see this <i>Marie Smith</i> standing before her. And this fit
continued sixteene houres, during which passion <i>Edward Drake</i> her
father came to the Towne, touched with griefe for this torture of his
daughter (as parents hearts are relenting and tender, and naturall
compassion is soone stirred vp in them) tooke her vrine, went to one for
his aduice (whose fact herein is no way iustifiable, and argued but a
small measure of religion, and the knowledge of God in him) who first
tolde vnto him the cause of his comming, that is, to seeke help for his
daughter, and then added, that she was so farre spent, that if hee had
stayed but one day longer, the woman
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<span class = "folionum">H3</span>
who had wronged her, would haue spent her heart, and so become
vnrecouerable, and thereupon shewed him her face in a Glasse; and
further, opened the beginning cause of falling out, which was for a hen,
which before this, <i>Drake</i> neyther knew nor heard of, and then gaue
his counsell for remedy, which was the matter sought for &amp; desired,
&amp; that was in this order. To make a cake with flower from the
Bakers, &amp; to mix the same instead of other liquor, with her own
water, and bake it on the harth, wherof the one halfe was to be applyed
and laid to the region of the heart, the other halfe to the back
directly opposit; &amp; further, gaue a box of ointment like triacle,
which must be spread vpon that cake, and a powder to be cast vpon the
same, and certaine words written in a paper, to be layd on the likewise
with the other, adding this caueat, that if his daughter did not amend
within six houres after the taking of these receits, then there was no
health or recouery to be looked for: &amp; further, wished silence to be
kept herein, for the womã who had done this, would know any thing.</p>

<p>And being thus furnishing with instructions, and returning home, as
shee alighted from his horse to enter into that house where his daughter
lay (being the next vnto <i>Mary Smiths</i>) shee then stood leaning
ouer her shop window, whom hee knew to be that person, which was shewed
vnto him, and she cursed him passing by, and told his daughter that her
Father had beene with a Wisard. And the next day following after they
had put in practise the directions giuen, she affirmed
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
to diuers of the neighbours, that <i>Drake</i> the afflicted womans
father, had beene to aske counsell, and made a Witch Cake, but shee
would learne how they came to haue that knowledge: yet for the present
she found helpe, and was freed from the languishing and other conflicts
wherewith she was assaulted by the space of sixe weekes.</p>

<p>After this, being married vnto <i>Iames Scot</i>, a great Cat which
kept with this Witch (of whose infernall both purposes and practises wee
now speake) frequented their house; and vpon doing some scathe, her
husband moued therwith, thrust it twice through with his sword: which
notwithstanding those wounds receiued, ran away: then he stroke it with
all his force vpon the head with a great pike staffe, yet could not kill
her; but shee leapt after this vpward almost a yard from the boords of
that chamber where she now was, and crept downe: which hee perceiuing,
willed his lad (a boy of foureteene yeares) to dragge her to the
muck-hill, but was not able; and therefore put her into a sacke, and
being in the same, still moued and stirred. Whereupon they put her out
againe, and cast her vnder a paire of staires, purposing in the morning,
to get more helpe, and carry her away; but then could not be found,
though all the doores that night were locked, and neuer heard what
afterward became thereof.</p>

<p>Not long after, this Witch came forth with a Birchin broome, and
threatned to lay it vpon the head of <i>Elizabeth Scot</i>, and defiled
her cloathes therewith, as she swept the street before her shop
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
doore, and that in the sight of her husband, who not digesting this
indignity offered vnto his wife, threatned that if she had any such
fits, as she endured being a Widow before marriage, hee would hang her.
At this she clapped her hands, and said hee killed her Cat. And within
two or three dayes after this enterchange of words betweene them, his
wife was perplexed with the like paine and griefe at her heart, as
formerly she had beene; and that for two dayes and a night: wherefore
her husband went to this wrathfull and malicious person, assuring that
if his wife did not amend, hee would accuse her to the Magistirate, and
cause the <a class = "tag" name = "tagNa" href = "#noteNa">a</a>rigor of
the law to be executed vpon her, which is due to such malefactors. These
things were done some three yeares sithence. The party troubled yet
liueth, but in no confirmed health, nor perfect soundnesse of body.</p>

<h3>Her wicked practises against Cicely Balye.</h3>

<p>A third subiect whereupon this wrathfull womans anger wrought, was
<i>Cicely Balye</i>, then seruant to <i>Robert Coulton</i>, now wife of
<i>William Vaux</i>, who sweeping the street before her maisters doore
vpon a Saturday in the euening, <i>Mary Smith</i> began to pick a
quarrell about the manner of sweeping, and said vnto her she was a great
fat-tail'd sow, but that fatnesse should shortly be pulled
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
downe and abated. And the next night being Sunday immediatly following,
a Cat came vnto her, sate vpon her breast, with which she was grieuously
tormented, and so oppressed, that she could not without great difficulty
draw her breath, and at the same instant did perfectly see the said
<i>Mary</i> in the chamber where she lay, who (as she conceiued) set
that Cat vpon her, and immediatly after fell sicke, languished, and grew
exceeding leane; and so continued for the space of halfe a yeare
together, during the whole continuance in her maisters seruice; vntill
departing from him, she dwelt with one Mistres <i>Garoway</i>, and then
began to bee amended in her health, and recouer of her former pining
sicknesse: for this Witch had said, that so long as she dwelt neere her,
she should not be well, but grow from euill to worse.</p>

<p>Thus euery light trifle (for what can be lesse then sweeping of a
lttle dust awry?) can minister matter to set on fire a wrathfull
indignation, and inflame it vnto desired reuenge, the Diuell being
willing to apprehend and take hold vpon such an occasion, that so he
might do some pleasing office to his bond-slaue, whom she adored in
submisse manner, vpon her knees, with strange gestures, vttering many
mumuring, broken, and imperfect speeches, as this <i>Cicely</i> did both
heare and see, there being no other partition between the chamber
wherein shee performed these rites, and the house of her maister with
whom she then dwelt, but only a thin seeling of boord, through a cranny
or rift of whereof she looked, listned attentiuely
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<span class = "folionum">I</span>
vnto her words, and beheld diligently her behauiour, and might haue
seene and heard much more, but that she was with the present spectacle
so affrighted, that she hastened downe in much feare and distemper.</p>


<h3>Her wicked practise against Edmund Newton.</h3>

<p>The fourth endammaged by this Hagge, was one <i>Edmund Newton</i>:
the discontentment did arise from this ground; Because hee had bought
seuerall bargaines of Holland cheese, and sold them againe, by which she
thought her benefit to be somewhat impaired, vsing the like kinde of
trading. The manner of her dealing with him was in this sort. At euery
seuerall time buying Cheese he was grieously afflicted, being thrice,
and at the last either she or a spirit in her likenesse did appeare vnto
him, and whisked about his face (as he lay in bed) a wet cloath of very
loathsome sauour; after which hee did see one cloathed in russet with a
little bush beard, who told him hee was sent to looke vpon his fore
legge, and would heale it; but rising to shew the same perceiuing hee
had clouen feet, refused that offer, who then (these being no vaine
conceits, or phantasies, but well aduised and diligently considered
obseruances) suddenly vanished out of sight. After this she
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
sent her Impes, a Toad, and Crabs crawling about the house, which was a
shoppe planchered with boords, where his seruants (hee being a
Shooemaker) did worke: one of which tooke that toad, put it into the
fire, where it made a groaning noyse for one quarter of an houre before
it was consumed; during which time <i>Mary Smith</i> who sent it, did
endure, (as was reported) torturing paines, testifying the felt griefe
by her out-cryes then made.</p>

<p>The sicknesse which he first sustained, was in manner of a madnesse
or phrensie, yet with some interposed release of extremity: so that for
thirteene or foureteene weekes together hee would be of perfect memory,
other times distracted and depriued of all sence. Also the ioynts and
parts of his body were benummed, besides other pains and greifes from
which hee is not yet freed, but continueth in great weakenesse, disabled
to performe any labour, whereby hee may get sufficient and competent
maintenance. And by the councel of some, sending for this woman by whom
hee was wronged, that he might scratch her (for this hath gone as
currant, and may plead prescription for warrant <ins class =
"correction" title = "unclear: may read 'as'">a*</ins> foule sinne among
Christians to thinke one Witch-craft can driue out another) his nailes
turned like feathers, hauing no strength to lay his hands
vpon&nbsp;her.</p>

<p>And it is not improbable but that she had dealt no better with others
then these aboue mentioned. For M<sup>r</sup> <i>Thomas Yonges</i> of
London, Fishmonger, reported vnto me, that after the demand of
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<span class = "folionum">I2</span>
a debt due vnto M<sup>r</sup> <i>Iohn Mason</i>, Silkeman of the same
Citie, whose Widow hee married, from <i>Henry Smith</i> Glouer her
husband, some execrations and curses being wished vnto him, within three
or foure dayes (being then gone to Yarmouth in Norfolke vpon necessary
businesse) there fell sicke, and was tortured with exceeding and
massacring griefes, which by no meanes (hauing vsed the aduise of sundry
learned and experienced Physitians in Norwich) could in any part be
mitigated, and so extraordinarily vexed thirteene moneths, was
constrained to go on Crutches, not being able to feed himselfe, and
amended not before this mischieuous woman was committed to prison
(accused for other wickednesses of the like kinde) at which time (so
neere as he could conjecture) he then receiued some release of his
former paines, though at the present when hee made this relation, which
was at Candlemas last past, had not perfectly recouered his wonted
strength: for his left hand remained lame, and without&nbsp;vse.</p>

<p>But thus much by the way onely, omitting how before this accident a
great Water-dogge ranne ouer his bed, the doore of the chamber where he
lay being shut, no such one knowne (for carefull enquiry was made)
either to haue been in that houfe where hee lodged, or in the whole
Towne at any time.</p>

<p>I doe not insist vpon this, because shee did not nominate him or any
other vnto vs, but onely those foure already expressed: and for the
wrongs
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
done to them, she craued mercy at Gods hands, as for all other her sins,
and in particular for that of Witch-craft, renounced the Diuell,
embraced the mercies of God purchased by the obedience of Iesus Christ,
and professed that her hope was onely by his suffering and passion to
bee saued. And all these, that is to say, her former grieuous offences
committed against God, and his people, her defiance of the Diuell, and
reposing all confidence of saluation in Christ Iesus alone, and his
merits, she in particular maner confessed openly at the place of
execution, in the audience of multitudes of people gathered together (as
is vsuall at such times) to be beholders of her death. And made there
also profession of her faith, and hope of a better life hereafter; and
the meanes whereby she trusted to obtaine the same, as before, hath
beene specified. And being asked, if she would be contented to haue a
Psalm sung, answered willingly that she desired the same, and appointed
it herselfe, <i>The Lamentation of a Sinner</i>, whose beginning is,
<i>Lord turne not away thy face, &amp;c</i>. And after the ending
thereof thus finished her life: So that in the iudgement of charity we
are to conceiue the best, and thinke shee resteth in peace,
notwithstanding her heynous transgressions formerly committed: for there
is no maladay incurable to the Almighty Physitian, <i>Esay 1. 18 Ezech.
33. 11</i>. Therefore <i>Caine</i> did iniury to God, when conuicted of
the barbarous and vnnaturall murther of his righteous brother, cryed out
tht his sinne was greater then could be forgiuen, <i>Gen. 4. 13</i>
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<span class = "folionum">I3</span>
for <i>Gods</i> mercy is greater then mans misery can be. And euen for
the like vnto this very fact, we haue a booke case, already adiudged,
and ouer-ruled in those <i>Ephesians</i>, who brought their coniuring
bookes, sacrificed them in the fire, æstimated at the <a class = "tag"
name = "tagNb" href = "#noteNb">b</a>value of nine hundred pounds of our
money, repented of their<a class = "tag" name = "tagNc" href =

<div class = "plainnote">
<a class = "note" name = "noteNc" href = "#tagNc">c.</a> The Ephesians
were infamous for their Magicall practises, <i>Appollonius</i>
professing the same in the Citie, so that it grewe into a prouerb, <span

Ephesian letters, which were certaine Characters and wordes, by vertue
whereof they obtained good successe in all businesse, victory against
others, euasion and escape from dangers; and as we reade in
<i>Suidas</i>, a Milesian armed with these letters, ouer-came thirty
Champions in the games of <i>Olimpus</i>, but being remoued by the
Magistrate, hauing intelligence thereof, himselfe was subdued. Of these

<h3>¶ The eight Proposition, and first consequent.</h3>

<p><span class = "firstletter">N</span>Ow
then from this premised narration, these two corrollaries or consequents
do necessarily follow.</p>

<p>It is not lawfull for any Christian to consult with a witch or
wisard, or goe to them for helpe. God himselfe, whose commandement is
and must be the rule of our life &amp; direction hath forbidden it,
<i>Leuit. 19. 31.</i> and <i>20. 6.</i> <i>Deuter. 18. 10.11</i>. And
the Imperiall lawes, haue beene in this case verie
respectiue.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8a" href = "#note8a">a</a>
Therefore, <i>Leo</i> the Emperour
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
straitly enioyneth, that none should resort vnto them, and stileth their
aduice nothing but meere impostures and deceit; and in the <a class =
"tag" name = "tag8b" href = "#note8b">b</a>Decrees collected by
<i>Gratian</i>, the teachers of the people are seriously exhorted to
admonish them, that magicall arts and inchantments cannot heale any
infirmity: and that they bee the dangerous snares, and subtilties of
that ancient enemy of mankind, by which he indeuoureth to entangle
them<a class = "tag" name = "tag8c" href = "#note8c">c</a>: and these so
streight and seuere prohibitions are not without iust and weighty cause.
For,</p>

<p>First, wee must haue no commerce or dealing with the diuell, eyther
directly and immediately, or mediately and indirectly; for we ought to
haue our recourse to God alone in all distresses, and this is that which
<i>Eliah</i> spake with great indignation vnto the messengers of
<i>Ahaziah</i>, who went to enquire of <i>Baal-zelub</i>, for the
recouerie of their Lords health, <i>2. King. 1. 3</i>.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8d" href = "#note8d">d</a> So that wee must not seeke to
Sathan, or any of his ministers. For none can serue two maisters,
<i>Matt. 6. 24</i>. But as religious <i>Iehosaphat</i>, when we know not
what to doe, then lift vp our eyes to heauen, <i>2 Chron. 20.
12</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, that help which any receiue from them bringeth destructon
of our soules, for such as seeke for relief this way, make a<a class =
"tag" name = "tag8e" href = "#note8e">e</a> separation &amp;
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
departing from God, which is the death of the soule. And though it may
be obiected, that some haue receiued benefite hereby, yet these are not
one of tenne. And further, wee are not to iudge heerein of the
lawfulnesse of these actions by the successe, but rest vpon the
commaundement, for it falleth out sometime, that a thiefe and common
robber by the high way, may liue in more aboundance, then those who with
a lawfull and honest trade painefully maintaine themeelues, yet
therefore hee is not iustified. And when wee haue recourse vnto others
beside God, we bewray herein our <a class = "tag" name = "tag8f" href =
"#note8f">f</a>distrust, infidelitie, contempt and rebellion against
him, which grieuous sinnes bring his wrath and eternall destruction. But
let it be taken for granted, that wee may receiue good by them, yet this
maxime is sure, &amp; a truth vnrepealeable, which no distinction can
elude; we must not doe euill that good may come thereof, <i>Rom. 3.
8.</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag8g" href = "#note8g">g</a> yea, it
were better to end our dayes in any extremitie whatsoeuer, then to vse
these for our helpers.</p>

<p>Thirdly, they<a class = "tag" name = "tag8h" href = "#note8h">h</a>
cure not diseases but in shew, except such as themselues haue inflicted,
otherwise those doe returne, as is reported of <i>Adrianus</i> the<a
class = "tag" name = "tag8i" href = "#note8i">i</a> Emperour, who
troubled with a dropsie, by magicall charmes did oftentimes empty the
water thereof, but in a short space increased againe; and perceiuing the
same to grow worse &amp; worse, sought to dispatch and rid himselfe of
life, by poyson, or the sword, or some other desperate attempts. Or a
worse malady (the first being abated) followeth: as I haue knowne one,
who vsing the help of
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
a wisard for the cure of a sore in his breast, prescribed in this sort:
crossed the place affected with his thumb, and mumbled to himself some
words in secret, after gaue the patient a powder like the ashes of wood,
which was to be boiled in running water, and with it to wash the vlcer,
after certaine clouts were to be applyed, with speciall care to lay that
side of the clout vnto the sore, which was by him crossed, and marked;
and all these clothes must at once be bound vpon it, and euery day the
lowest remoued or taken away: thus in short time that anguish and griefe
ceased; but not long after the party fell into a more grieuous
infirmity, and still continueth therein. Or if the euill be taken from
the<a class = "tag" name = "tag8k" href = "#note8k">k</a> person
presently afflicted, then is it layd vpon his friends children or
cattell, and sometime it falleth to the lot of the witch herselfe, so
that alwayes the diuell is a diuell, doing euill, and working
mischiefe.</p>

<p>Fourth, a <a class = "tag" name = "tag8l" href =
"#note8l">l</a>wisard, witch, or sorcerer can not releeue any but by his
or her inuocation, and help of the diuell, but this fact is absoluteIy,
and without exception, wicked, and can by no limitation or circumstance
bee made tolerable: Therefore they who require this at their hands,
which they cannot performe without committing of sinne, be liable to the
same vengeance and wrath of God to which they are; for not only the
principall offenders, but the <a class = "tag" name = "tag8m" href =
"#note8m">m</a>accessaries, and consenters to their euill, are worthy of
death, <i>Rom. 1. 32</i>.</p>

<p>Now before I conclude this poynt, because by these kinde of
creatures, many toyes bee vsed, to
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<span class = "folionum">K</span>
shaddow and maske the diuells suggestion and workes, it shall not be
amisse to mention some of them, and among the rest be <a class = "tag"
name = "tag8n" href = "#note8n">n</a>characters written or grauen in
plates of mettall: and for these it is most certayne that Quantities
haue no actiue qualitie; and therefore, if any expected successe
according to desire doe follow in the vse thereof, it proceedeth from
the illusion of Sathan, and is his worke, that hereby he might winne
credite to his crafty fleights and conueyances, and procure to himselfe
authority, establishing the kingdome of darknesse, withdraw men from
resting vpon God, and reposing their trust in his almighty power, and
boundlesse mercy, and sollicite them to expect helpe from him. There are
besides these, other idle trifles (for they deserue no better name which
are appoynted to be hung about the neck) for Amulets, as <a class =
"tag" name = "tag8o" href = "#note8o">o</a>powerfull and effectuall
remedies against certayne diseases, and pictures made of gold, brasse,
lead, wax, &amp;c. which neyther haue nor can haue any other vertue,
then that which they doe receiue from the matter wherof they be framed,
for the figure worketh not as a cause of alteration; but if it bring to
passe any other effect that is from the power of the diuell an old
enemy, and craftie deluder of mankinde, and therefore, presupposeth a
contract made with him: wherefore <a class = "tag" name = "tag8p" href =
"#note8p">p</a><i>Antoninus Caracalla</i> condemned those who vsed the
same, for the helpe of Tertian and Quartan agues, and
<i>Constantius</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag8q" href = "#note8q">q</a>
decreeth such to be woorthy capitall punishment, and put to death. And
that naturall couer wherewith some children
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
are borne, and is called by our women, the sillie how, Midwiues were
wont to sell to credulous Aduocates and Lawyers, as an especiall meanes
to furnish them with eloquence<a class = "tag" name = "tag8r" href =
"#note8r">r</a> and perswasiue speech, and to stoppe the mouthes of all,
who should make any opposition against them: for which cause one <a
class = "tag" name = "tag8s" href = "#note8s">s</a><i>Protus</i> was
accused by the Clergie of Constantinople to haue offended in this
matter. And <i>Chrysostome</i> often accuseth Midwiues for reseruing the
same to Magicall vses. And <i>Clemens<a class = "tag" name = "tag8t"
href = "#note8t">t</a> Alexandrinus</i> giueth vs to vnderstand of one
<i>Erecestus</i>, who had two inchaunted rings, so framed, that by the
sound thereof he had direction for the fit time and <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads 'opoortunity'">opportunity</ins> in
mannaging all the businesses hee intended, and yet notwithstanding was
priuily murthered, though hee had warning giuen by that sound which was
his vsuall instructer. Thus, none can escape the reuenging hand of God,
which pursueth those who haue infeoffed themselues to such vanities, and
are besotted with these vnlawfull curiosities. But among all other,
charmes and inchaunting spells, haue gotten the start of the rest, which
some think absolutely lawfull, and may vpon warrantise bee vsed, and
pleade prescription for their iustification; for wee reade in
<i>Homer</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag8u" href = "#note8u">u</a> that
<i>Vlysses</i> being wounded by words, stayed the flux of blood; and <a
class = "tag" name = "tag8x" href = "#note8x">x</a><i>Cardanus</i> tells
vs, that himselfe cutting his lip, could by no meanes restraine the
flowing blood, vntill he charmed it, and then presently stanched: but
dare not affirm whether his owne confidence, or the words did make this
restraint. I might adde
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<span class = "folionum">K2</span>
to these, that infallible meanes (as is supposed) by finding out a
thiefe with a Siue and a payre of Sheares, with that coniunction <a
class = "tag" name = "tag8y" href = "#note8y">y</a><i>Dies, mies,
Iescet, &amp;c.</i> and the rest of such sencelesse and monstrous
tearmes, a Riddle that <i>Oedipus</i> himselfe could not vnfolde. But
because this conceit of charming hath ouer-spread it selfe in this
Sunneset of the world, and challengeth a lawfull approbation from the
authority and practise of ancient <a class = "tag" name = "tag8z" href =
"#note8z">z</a>Physitians, yea and found some <a class = "tag" name =
"tag8aa" href = "#note8aa">aa</a>Diuines to be their Patrons
respectiuely, and with clauses of mitigation, I thinke it very
necessarie to shew the vnlawfulness thereof. Wherefore,</p>

<p>First, they had their originall and beginning from the diuell, who
abode not in the truth, <i>Iohn 8. 44.</i> was cast downe with the
apostata angels to hell, and deliuered into chaines of darkenesse, <i>2.
Pet. 2. 4.</i> who enuying mans felicity receiued into grace after the
<a class = "tag" name = "tag8bb" href = "#note8bb">bb</a>fall, himselfe
eternally reiected, omitted no occasion to weaken and ouerthrow the
same, that the benefite thereof might come but to a few, and the
greatest number perish with him for euer. Whereupon he endeuoured to
inwrappe the weaker sort of that fraile corporation in superstitions,
beguile them with doubtfull and false oracles, and bring to a forme of
worshippe contrary to that which God had commaunded, <a class = "tag"
name = "tag8cc" href = "#note8cc">cc</a>whereby the world beganne to
abound with Idolatry, disobedience, contempt, murthers, vncleanenesse,
lusts, thefts, lying, and such like outrages: and that hee might with
his infections impoyson them more dangerously, and soueraigne
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
in their hearts, he vndertooke to worke wonders, imitating such miracles
as God had done, and deuised cunningly many subtile sleights and
legerdemaines, and for this end most blasphemously abused the glorious
and holy name of God, and the word vttered by his mouth, and represented
a false shew of those effects, which hee had wrought in nature: and
heerein leuelled at two intentions, one to reproch God, and
counterchecke his works; the other to ouer-mask and couer his owne
secret traps and frauds, perswading men, that by the power of wordes
these things were brought to pass, which must needes therefore be of
great efficacie: seeing that the world &amp; all things therein were so
made of nothing; for he spake, and they were created, and thus practised
to disgrace, and extenuate, that admirable and great worke of Creation,
and cause men to make lighter account of the Creator, seeing that they
also (instructed by him) were enabled thorow the pronunciation of
certayne words contriued into a speciall forme, eyther to infuse new
strength into things, or depriue them of that which formerly they had,
or alter the course of Nature, in raysing tempests, stirring vp thunder
and lightning; in <a class = "tag" name = "tag8dd" href =
"#note8dd">dd</a>taming serpents, and depriuing them of their naturall
fiercenesse and venime, and cause wilde beasts to become meeke and
tractable, yea in seeming to make sensible bodies; as cloudes, wind,
raine &amp; the like. And thus the diuell is that father who begot
Charmes, and brought them foorth, not powerfull in themselues, but by
that
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<span class = "folionum">K3</span>
inter-league which hee hath with those who are invassaled
vnto&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>Secondly, God doth as straitly prohibit them, and seuerely punish the
practisers thereof, as others offending in any exercise of vnlawfull
arts, <i>Deut. 18. 10.11</i>. There shall not be found among you
(instructing the Israelites his people) a charmer, &amp;c. for these are
abhomination vnto the Lord, &amp;c. And this is recorded in the
Catalogue of those sinnes of <i>Manasses</i>, by which hee sought to
prouoke God vnto anger, <i>2. Kin. 21. 8.</i> <i>2. Chronicles 33.
6</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, words haue no vertue,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8ee" href =
"#note8ee">ee</a> <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads 'bnt'">but</ins>
either to signifie and expresse the conceits of the
minde, or to affect the eares of the Auditors, so that they can worke
nothing but in these two respects: first of the matter which is vttered
by them, which vnderstood of the hearers, affect the mind diuersly, and
that especially when there is ioyned with it a comelinesse of action and
pronunciation, as wee we see oftentimes in the speeches of the Ministers
of the Word, and in the pleadings of Orators. As when <i>Paul</i>
reasoned before <ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original: Felix"><i>Fœlix</i></ins>
and <i>Drusilla</i> his wife, of Temperance,
Righteousnesse, and Iudgement to come, hee trembled, <i>Acts 24. 25.</i>
<a class = "tag" name = "tag8ff" href = "#note8ff">ff</a>being guilty to
himselfe of fraudulent and cruell dealing, of lasciuiousnesse and a
filthy life, and therefore might iustly feare vengeance for the
same.</p>

<p>A like example to this is that in King <i>Agrippa</i>, though working
vpon a better subject, <i>Act. 26. 28</i>. And if I may conioyne Diuine
eloquence
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
with Humane, it is memorable, that while <a class = "tag" name =
"tag8gg" href = "#note8gg">gg</a><i>Tully</i> pleaded before
<i>Cæsar</i> for <i>Ligarius</i>, accused by <i>Tubero</i>, to haue
beene confederate with <i>Pompey</i>, purposing to put him to death, as
an enemy, when the Orator altered, and in Rhetoricall manner inforced
his speech, the other changed accordingly his countenance, and bewrayed
the piercing words to be so affecting, that the supplications, when he
came once to vrge and mention the battell of <i>Pharsalia</i>,
(trembling and dismayed) did fall from his hands, hauing the passions of
his minde extraordinarily moued, and absolued the offender. Or else when
by their pleasantnesse, with delight they slide into the hearts of men,
and rauish their affections: and thus it was with <a class = "tag" name
= "tag8hh" href = "#note8hh">hh</a><i>Augustine,</i> as he acknowledgeth
of himselfe, that being at <i>Milaine</i> where he was baptized by <i>S.
Ambrose</i>, when he heard the harmony which was in singing of the
Psalmes, the words pierced his eares, the truth melted his heart, his
passions were moued, and showers of teares with delight fell from his
eyes.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8ii" href = "#note8ii">ii</a> But these
effects are wrought onely in such who vnderstand that which is spoken,
but neither of both these properties are to bee found in the Charmes of
Wisards: besides, that they are conceiued and expressed in monstrous and
vnknowne tearmes, not intelligible, and without signification: and
therefore the effects they produce being<a class = "tag" name = "tag8kk"
href = "#note8kk">kk</a> supernaturall must proceed from that secret
compact, the least made with the Diuell.</p>

<p>Fourthly, these charmes are meere mockeries,
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
and grosse abuses, both of God, and Men his creatures, I will giue you a
taste of one or two, whereby you may iudge of the rest, for they came
all out of one shoppe, and are fashioned in one forge, and haue the same
workman or Artificer. <a class = "tag" name = "tag8ll" href =
"#note8ll">ll</a>An old woman crauing helpe for bleare eyes, had
deliuered a Billet of Paper to weare about her necke, in which was
written, <i>The Diuell pull out thine eyes</i>, and recouered. Anothere
tied a scroule to a sicke man, full of strange Characters, with which
were intermingled a few names of Diuels, as <i>Lucifer</i>,
<i>Sathan</i>, <i>Belzebub</i>, <i>Oriens</i>, <i>Behal</i>,
<i>Mammon</i>, <i>Beuflar</i>, <i>Narthin</i>, <i>Oleasar, &amp;c.</i>

likely to be medicinable, a Christian truely instructed in Gods word
knoweth; and the Lord who is the father of mercies, and God of all
comfort, preserue vs from such blasphemies, which are the Diuels

present release or comfort, what then? here is the tryall of thy
patience, haue not recourse to superstitious and vnlawfull helpers,
although they promise thee present remedy; and when they fore-tell thee
of things which doe truely according to the prediction to fall out,
beleeue them not, follow the example of Christ, who rebuked the Diuell,
though he called him (as he was indeed) the Son of God. For vnder the
vaile of truth he shadoweth falshood; euen as if one should sweeten with
honey or sugar the brimme of the Cup wherein he bringeth poyson: But
some will say, they call vpon the name of the Lord of Sabbaoth. Well,
but this title they giue not to God, but to the Diuell: therefore betake
thou thy selfe to God alone, craue health at his hand, and follow the
Apostles direction; <i>If any bee sicke among you, let him call for the
Elders of the Church, and let him pray</i>, Iames 5.&nbsp;14.</p>

<h3>The ninth Proposition, and second Corrolary.</h3>

<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>Here
hath alwayes beene some wanton, or peruerse wits, who only to make
triall of their skill, would take in hand to defend absurd positions,
and commend both such things and persons, which were infamous, and
contemptible as <a class = "tag" name = "tag9a" href =

"tag" name = "tag9f" href = "#note9f">f</a>ancient Orators, wee finde
those who strained all their vnderstanding to blaze the honour of that
witlesse and deformed Coward <i>Thersites</i>. And this they haue
performed with great Art and eloquence, onely to shew their faculty, but
neuer in good earnest took such a matter in hand. And therefore more
deeply is hee to be censured, who hath made himselfe an aduocate to
plead the cause of <a class = "tag" name = "tag9g" href =
"#note9g">g</a>Witches, and defend thẽ as innocent. And because this is
a dangerous example, and doth draw those who are euill affected to
offend, hoping for patronage of their impiety, I adde for conclusion
this last proposition: Wisards, Witches, and the whole rabble of
Sorcerers (no kinde excepted) are iustly liable<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9h" href = "#note9h">h</a> to extreame punishment. The arguments
alleaged for
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
proofe hereof, are many: I will make choyce of a few (with reference to
such authors in whose writings more may bee found) and those which are
most<a class = "tag" name = "tag9i" href = "#note9i">i</a>
demonstratiue.</p>

<p>First, God himselfe hath enacted that pœnall statute, <i>Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to liue. Exod. 22 18.</i> and nameth here a <a class
= "tag" name = "tag9k" href = "#note9k">k</a>woman practising this
damnable Art for two reasons: First, they are more inclinable hereunto
then man. Secondly, that though their fault may seeme, as being the
weaker, excuseable, and is in this respect extenuated by some, yet is
not therefore to bee spared, whether of that sort which they call <a
class = "tag" name = "tag9l" href = "#note9l">l</a>good, or bad (for so
are they distinguished) &amp; there be some who neuer brought<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9m" href = "#note9m">m</a> harme vpon any in body,
goods, or minde. The cause of this so sharpe a doome, is their
compacting with the Diuell, openly or secretly, whereby they couenant to
vse his helpe, in fulfilling their desires, and by this meanes make
themselues guilty of horrible impiety: for in this they renounce the
Lord, who hath created them; make no account of his fauour and
protection, cut themselues off from the couenant made with him in
baptisme, from the communion of Saints, the true fellowship and seruice
of God; and on the contrary yeeld themselues by this confederacy, to
Sathan, as their God (and therefore nothing more frequent and vsuall in
their mouthes, then my God will do this <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads 'aud'">and</ins> that for me) him they continually feare
and honour. And thus do at the last become professed enemies both to God
and Man. You may adde to this former
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<span class = "folionum">L2</span>
law, that which is <i>Leuit. 19. 26.</i> &amp; <i>cap. 6</i>. <i>You
shall vse no inchantment: the soule that turneth after such as haue
familiar spirits, and are Wisards, to goe a whooring after them, I will
set my face against that soule, and will cut him off from among his
people, &amp;c.</i> Againe, <i>Deut. 18. 10</i>. <i>There shall not bee
found among you any that vseth Diuination, nor an obseruer of times, or
an inchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a consulter with familiar
spirits, a Wisard, or Necromancer.</i> And that God might shew how<a
class = "tag" name = "tag9n" href = "#note9n">n</a> much <i>Manasses</i>
had prouoked him to wrath, through his transcendent and outragious
sinnes in the Catalogue thereof, his conspiring with Diuels is mentioned
<i>1. King 21. 8</i>. And therefore is depriued of his kingdome, bound
in fetters, and carried captiue vnto <i>Babel</i>, <i>2. Chron. 33.
6.11.</i> and though he repented of these outragious and enormious
transgressions, yet God would not bee appeased for them fiftie yeares
after he was dead, <i>Ierem. 15.&nbsp;4.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, the ciuill lawes in this case are most strict, decreeing
them to bee burned, and their goods confiscate, though they were persons
of quality, and honourable, seated in dignity, and place of
<ins class = "correction" title =
"position of footnote tags conjectural">authority</ins>:<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9o" href = "#note9o">o</a>
and there is a seuere constitution made by <a class =
"tag" name = "tag9p" href = "#note9p">p</a><ins class = "correction"
title = "position of footnote tags conjectural"><i>Charles</i></ins> the
fift in late dayes against them, that though they shall not haue done,
or be conuinced to haue hurt any, yet because they attempted a thing
vnlawfull, and abhominable vnto God, are extraordinarily to be punished.
And concerning this particular, S. <i>Augustin</i> discourseth
excellently, worthy to be read, <i>de ciu. dei. l. 8.
c.&nbsp;19.</i></p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">76</span>
Thirdly, God willeth those should bee put to death, who by Diabolical
and vnlawfull Arts, do endeuour to helpe or harme others, whether in act
they performe the same, or purpose with intention, conceiuing and
thinking they can do it, with ranke Witches must needs be marshalled;
and therefore iustly subiect to deserued punishment.</p>

<p>Fourthly, all Idolaters are to dye by diuine appointment, <i>Deu. 17.
5</i>. But I thinke no mans forehead is so brasen, that will stand
Proctor, and plead guiltlesse for these sort of people, who deuote
themselues wholly to the Diuell, though neuer so closely, and with great
and cautelous secresie: and no doubt God therefore was reuenged of the
Templars, and their detestable wickednesse practised in darknesse and
obscurity, who all<a class = "tag" name = "tag9q" href = "#note9q">q</a>
perished, as it were, in a moment for the same; of which at the full we
may be informed in our owne ancient histories.</p>

<p>Fifthly, they doe solicite others to be of their profession (which is
one clause of that contract made betweene them and the Diuell) and
consecrate their childen vnto him: and against this, there is an
especiall caution put in <i>Deuteronomy 13. 6.9.10.</i></p>

<p>Sixtly, they deserue death as inhumane and barbarous tyrants, for
lingringly <i>vt sentiant se mori</i>, that they may feele how they doe
decay by degrees, seek the vtter ouerthrow of those whom they doe
maligne: and as a further appendix to this, oftentimes by the helpe of
their grand teacher,
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<span class = "folionum">L3</span>
sowe discord betweene husband and wife, sollicite maydens, yea enforce
both them, and married women to vncleane, and vnlawfull lusts, and
heerein implore the helpe of the diuell, to accomplish their malicious
designes, which trangression is capitall.</p>

<p>Seuenthly, the exercise of this act or vanity is punishable by death,
although it be practised but onely in sport and ieast, which appeare
thus, because God hath seriously forbidden (and vnder no lesse
forfeiture of life it self) to aske counsell of a Soothsayer or
Coniurer; if this then be a crime of such nature, in those, who it may
bee heerein thought not to doe euill, ther is no reason to induce any to
thinke that hee will spare the wilfull, and purposed authors thereof,
and Magitians, who worke onely iuggling trickes, and illusions, and
fore-tell some future things, as yet vnknowne vntill they doe so fall
out, are not freed from the sentence condemnatorie, much more then those
who willingly, and vpon premeditated malice, murther or impaire the life
and good estate of other, deserue to stand paralell with them. And there
can no reson be yielded of this so sharp a censure, but onely because
they haue learned, and accordingly exercise vnlawfull arts, for
whosoeuer endeuoureth to bring that thing to passe, by pretending
naturall meanes, which exceedeth the power of Nature, and is now
thereunto enabled eyther by God, or the ministery of good Angells at his
appoyntment, hee must of necessity haue this faculty communicated by
some combination
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
and inter league with the diuell.</p>

<p>Eightly, the Iudge or ciuil Magistrate is bound by vertue of that
office, and superioritie he sustaineth in the common-wealth, to purge
and free that place, in, and ouer which he hath command, of all
malefactors, which if he doe neglect, then is a double offender, against
the Law both of Iustice and Charity; for hee is obliged by duety to
foresee (so much as in him lyeth) that the publike state should be
secured, which it concerneth to haue offenders punished, otherwise hee
maketh himselfe partner with them in their outrages and offences, and
standeth answerable for those damages sustained by the whole bodie of
the people in generall, or vndergone by any particular of the same, for
sparing of the wicked<a class = "tag" name = "tag9r" href =
"#note9r">r</a> is hurting the good, and hee that doth not represse and
forbid euill (when it is in his power) doth countenance and
maintaine&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Much more might be added, and many examples produced, to manifest,
how in all Nations these odious company of witches, and the like haue
euer beene accounted detestable; and for their impious deedes requited
with neuer dying shame, aud vtter confusion, and iustly by law executed;
for among the Romans, Mathematitians,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9s"
href = "#note9s">s</a> and Magitians by the Decree of the Senate were
expelled out of all Italy: and amongst these <i>Pituanus</i> was throwne
downe from the rock <i>Tarpeius</i>, and crushed apeeces. <i>Martius</i>
by the Consuls put to death with the sound of a Trumpet without the gate
<i>Exquilina</i>: <i>Publicia</i> and <i>Licinia</i>
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
women,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9t" href = "#note9t">t</a> and
seauenty more witches hanged. The <a class = "tag" name = "tag9u" href =
"#note9u">u</a>speedy judgement of the Athenians, witnesse of their
hatred against these kinde of malefactors, is much commended, who
without any other solemnity of proceeding at the onely accusation of a
Maide, without delay put one <i>Lemnia</i> a witch to death: and it is
memorable which <i>Ammianus<a class = "tag" name = "tag9x" href =
"#note9x">x</a> Marcellinus</i> hath left in record, that one
<i>Hilarius</i>, because hee committed his sonne yong, and not of mature
yeares, to be taught and instructed vnto a Coniurer, was adjudged to
die, and escaping from the hands of the executioner, who had negligently
bound him, drawne by force out of the next church of the Christians to
which hee fled as vnto a Sanctuary, and executed.</p>

<p>The end of <a class = "tag" name = "tag9y" href =
"#note9y">y</a><i>Varasolo</i>, a famous Inchantresse in Hungarie is
dreadfull, who for her sundry witcheries was cast into prison, and there
constrayned through extremity of hunger, to reare off and eate the flesh
of her owne legges and armes, and at the last, impatient of further
delay, there murthered herselfe, and shortned the span of her life.</p>

<p>But here I stay my hand, take it from the table, and the rather,
because much hath already beene spoken to this purpose. Wherefore, for
conclusion, I shut vp this whole Treatise with a remarkeable speech of a
noble <a class = "tag" name = "tag9z" href = "#note9z">z</a>King; Let
the streight rigor
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
of law bee inflicted vpon all, both practisers and partakers with
wisards, by putting any confidence in them; for it is vngodly for man to
be remisse and fauourable vnto those whom diuine piety, and our duety to
God will not suffer vnpunished. For what folly were it to forsake the
Creator and Giuer of life, and to follow the author of death? this
dishonest fact, vnbeseeming, and vtterly repugnant to the credite and
reputation of a Iudge, be farre from him. Let none countenance that
which the Lawes doe condemne, for all are by the Regall Edicts to bee
punished with death, who intermeddle with such forbidden and vnlawfull
Artes.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
